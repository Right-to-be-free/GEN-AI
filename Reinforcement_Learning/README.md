Reinforcement Learning Guide
What is Reinforcement Learning (RL)?
**Definition**: Reinforcement Learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns by interacting with an environment to maximize cumulative rewards.
**Analogy**: Like training a pet with treats—good behavior earns rewards, bad behavior earns nothing.
```python
# Basic RL loop
state = env.reset()
for _ in range(100):
    action = agent.choose_action(state)
    next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
    agent.learn(state, action, reward, next_state)
    state = next_state
    if done:
        break
```
Why Reinforcement Learning?
**Use Case**: Useful in situations with sequential decisions and delayed rewards.
**Examples**: Game playing (chess, Go), self-driving cars, stock trading bots.
Key Elements of RL
- **Agent**: The learner (e.g., robot).
- **Environment**: Where the agent acts (e.g., grid, game).
- **State (s)**: The current situation.
- **Action (a)**: The possible moves.
- **Reward (r)**: Feedback received.
- **Policy (π)**: Strategy mapping states to actions.
```python
action = policy[state]  # Simple policy lookup
```
Exploration vs Exploitation
**Definition**: Choosing between exploring new actions or exploiting known ones.
**Analogy**: Trying a new restaurant vs. eating at your favorite.
Epsilon-Greedy Algorithm
**Definition**: A strategy to balance exploration and exploitation using a probability threshold.
```python
import random
if random.random() < epsilon:
    action = random.choice(actions)  # Explore
else:
    action = best_action(state)      # Exploit
```
Markov Decision Process (MDP)
**Definition**: A framework where outcomes depend only on the current state and action.
**Components**: States (S), Actions (A), Transition Probabilities (P), Rewards (R), Discount Factor (γ)
Q-values and V-values
- **Q(s,a)**: Expected reward of taking action a in state s.
- **V(s)**: Expected reward from state s under a policy.
```python
V[s] = max(Q[s,a] for a in actions)  # Value from best action
```
Alpha (α) - Learning Rate
**Definition**: Determines how much new info overrides the old.
```python
Q[s,a] += alpha * (reward + gamma * max(Q[next_s, a]) - Q[s,a])
```
Gamma (γ) - Discount Factor
**Definition**: Controls the importance of future rewards.
```python
# High gamma = more long-term focus
Q[s,a] += alpha * (reward + gamma * max(Q[next_s, a]) - Q[s,a])
```
Q-Learning Algorithm (Off-Policy)
```python
# Q-learning update rule
Q[s,a] = Q[s,a] + alpha * (reward + gamma * max(Q[next_s, :]) - Q[s,a])
```
Example: FrozenLake-v1 (OpenAI Gym)
```python
import gym
import numpy as np

env = gym.make("FrozenLake-v1", is_slippery=False)
Q = np.zeros((env.observation_space.n, env.action_space.n))

epsilon, alpha, gamma = 0.1, 0.8, 0.95

for episode in range(1000):
    state = env.reset()
    done = False
    while not done:
        if np.random.rand() < epsilon:
            action = env.action_space.sample()
        else:
            action = np.argmax(Q[state])
        next_state, reward, done, _, _ = env.step(action)
        Q[state, action] += alpha * (reward + gamma * np.max(Q[next_state]) - Q[state, action])
        state = next_state
```
Final Summary and Best Practices
- Start with simple environments (Gridworld, FrozenLake).
- Balance exploration (ε) and learning rate (α).
- Monitor convergence and reward trends.
- Visualize Q-values and policy maps for interpretation.
- Gradually introduce stochasticity and complex dynamics.
