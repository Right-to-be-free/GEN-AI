### What Are Transformers in Machine Learning?

Transformers are a type of deep learning model architecture introduced in the paper “Attention Is All You Need” (Vaswani et al., 2017). They revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) by enabling models to capture context across entire sequences without relying on recurrence (as in RNNs) or convolutions (as in CNNs).

### Key Components of a Transformer

#### 1. **Input Embedding**

* Words are converted into numerical vectors (word embeddings).
* Positional encoding is added to give the model information about the position of each word in the sequence.

#### 2. **Positional Encoding**

* Since transformers don't process sequences sequentially, they need position information.
* Adds sinusoidal signals to embeddings to encode word positions in the sequence.

#### 3. **Multi-Head Self-Attention**

* Enables the model to focus on different words (including itself) in a sentence.
* Calculates attention scores between all word pairs.
* Multi-head allows learning various context relationships simultaneously.

#### 4. **Layer Normalization**

* Applied after each sub-layer (e.g., attention, feed-forward).
* Stabilizes and speeds up training.

#### 5. **Feed-Forward Network**

* A two-layer fully connected network applied to each position separately and identically.

#### 6. **Residual Connections**

* Shortcuts around the attention and feed-forward layers.
* Helps mitigate vanishing gradients and accelerates learning.

#### 7. **Encoder and Decoder Architecture**

* **Encoder**: A stack of layers each containing:

  * Multi-head self-attention
  * Feed-forward network
* **Decoder**: A stack with:

  * Masked multi-head self-attention
  * Multi-head attention over encoder output
  * Feed-forward network

#### 8. **Masking**

* Ensures that predictions for a position can depend only on known outputs (used in decoders).

### Pros of Transformers

✅ **Parallelization**: Unlike RNNs, transformers process the whole sequence at once, allowing faster training on GPUs.

✅ **Long-Range Dependencies**: Self-attention captures relationships across the entire sequence.

✅ **Scalability**: Easily scaled up for large models (e.g., BERT, GPT, T5).

✅ **Flexibility**: Can be adapted for tasks in NLP, vision (ViT), speech, bioinformatics, etc.

---

### Cons of Transformers

❌ **Computational Cost**: Self-attention scales quadratically with sequence length (O(n²)).

❌ **Data Hunger**: Needs large datasets to train effectively.

❌ **Interpretability**: Understanding attention patterns doesn't always explain decisions.

❌ **Training Complexity**: Requires significant engineering for optimization and fine-tuning.

### Why Transformers Are Better

1. **Compared to RNNs**:

   * RNNs suffer from vanishing gradients and are sequential (slower).
   * Transformers allow direct access to any token via attention, enabling better context capture.

2. **Compared to CNNs**:

   * CNNs rely on local context and fixed-size kernels.
   * Transformers flexibly model global dependencies.

3. **Success Stories**:

   * Powered state-of-the-art models like BERT, GPT, T5, RoBERTa.
   * Dominated NLP benchmarks and transitioned successfully into vision (ViT) and multimodal models (CLIP, DALL·E).

### What is Self-Attention?

**Self-attention** is a mechanism that allows a model to weigh the importance of different words (or tokens) in a sequence relative to each other when encoding a single word. It is the core component of the **Transformer** architecture, enabling models to understand context across sequences without relying on recurrence.

---

## 🔍 Detailed Components of Self-Attention

Given a sequence of input vectors $X = [x_1, x_2, ..., x_n]$, self-attention computes the representation of each word based on **every other word**.

### 1. **Query, Key, and Value (Q, K, V)**

Each input vector $x_i$ is transformed into three vectors:

* **Query**: What the word is looking for in other words
* **Key**: What the word offers
* **Value**: The actual information carried by the word

These are computed as:

$$
Q = XW^Q,\quad K = XW^K,\quad V = XW^V
$$

Where $W^Q, W^K, W^V$ are learned parameter matrices.

---

### 2. **Scaled Dot-Product Attention**

To compute attention, we take the dot product between queries and keys:

$$
\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V
$$

* $QK^T$: similarity scores between each query and key
* $\sqrt{d_k}$: scaling factor to prevent exploding gradients
* Softmax: normalizes scores to form weights
* Final multiplication with $V$: aggregates information from all tokens

---

### 3. **Multi-Head Attention**

Instead of doing attention once, we do it $h$ times in parallel with different learned projections:

$$
\text{head}_i = \text{Attention}(QW_i^Q, KW_i^K, VW_i^V)
$$

Then concatenate and project:

$$
\text{MultiHead}(Q,K,V) = \text{Concat}(\text{head}_1,...,\text{head}_h)W^O
$$

This allows the model to attend to **multiple types of relationships**.

---

### 4. **Masking (in decoder)**

In the decoder (e.g., during language generation), future tokens are masked to prevent "cheating":

* A **triangular mask** sets scores to $-\infty$ where future positions are, so softmax gives them zero attention.

## 🧠 Real-World Analogy

Think of a meeting room:

* Each person (word) can listen to and judge the importance of **everyone else's statement** (attention).
* They adjust their understanding based on **the whole conversation**.

### 🔍 What is BERT?

**BERT** (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a **pretrained language model** developed by Google in 2018. It marked a breakthrough in NLP by introducing **deep bidirectional** context representation, meaning it considers both the **left and right** context of a word simultaneously.

> 📄 Paper: [*BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805)

---

## 🔧 Architecture Components of BERT

BERT is built entirely from the **Transformer encoder stack**—no decoder is used.

### 1. **Input Embeddings**

Each token is represented by the sum of:

* **Token Embeddings**: Vocabulary lookup (e.g., WordPiece tokens)
* **Segment Embeddings**: Indicates sentence A or B (for next sentence prediction)
* **Positional Embeddings**: Encodes token position in the sequence

$$
\text{InputEmbedding} = \text{Token} + \text{Segment} + \text{Position}
$$

---

### 2. **Transformer Encoder Layers**

BERT has a stack of identical Transformer encoder layers (12 in BERT-base, 24 in BERT-large). Each layer consists of:

* **Multi-Head Self-Attention**

  * Helps the model understand dependencies between all words in the input.
* **Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFN)**

  * Fully connected layers applied to each token.
* **Layer Normalization + Residual Connections**

  * Applied after attention and FFN for stable training.

---

### 3. **CLS Token**

* A special `[CLS]` token is prepended to every input.
* Its final hidden state is used for **classification tasks**.

---

### 4. **SEP Token**

* Used to separate two sentences in **Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)** or mark end of a sentence in **single-sentence tasks**.

---

## 🎓 BERT’s Training Objectives

### a) **Masked Language Modeling (MLM)**

* 15% of input tokens are **masked** at random.
* BERT learns to **predict the masked tokens** using both left and right context.

Example:
*Input*: "The man went to the \[MASK] to buy food."
*Prediction*: "store"

### b) **Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)**

* Input: Pair of sentences (A, B)
* Task: Predict whether B follows A in the original text.

This helps BERT understand sentence relationships.
