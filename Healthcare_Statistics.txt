1. Probability – Predicting Disease Risk  
Imagine a COVID-19 test where 5 out of 100 people test positive. The probability that a randomly chosen person has COVID-19 is:  

P(COVID-19) = 5/100 = 0.05 (or 5%)

2. Vector Spaces – Patient Health Data Representation  
A patient’s health data can be represented as a vector with different parameters:  

V = [Blood Sugar, Heart Rate, Cholesterol] = [110, 80, 200]

Each patient has a unique vector. Together, all patient vectors form a vector space, helping doctors analyze health trends.

3. Eigenvectors & Eigenvalues – Identifying Major Health Factors  
Hospitals track patient health using multiple factors (Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, BMI, Sugar Levels). Instead of analyzing them separately, eigenvectors help identify the most important factor influencing patient health.  

For example, PCA (Principal Component Analysis) might show that 90% of the health variation comes from BMI and Cholesterol, meaning they are the key factors to focus on.

4. Correlation – Finding Links Between Health Conditions  
If we analyze daily exercise vs. heart disease risk, we might find:  

- Negative correlation: More exercise → Lower heart disease risk (-0.7 correlation).  
- Positive correlation: More fast food → Higher obesity (+0.8 correlation).

5. Mean, Median & Mode – Hospital Wait Times  
Suppose a hospital tracks how long patients wait before seeing a doctor. The recorded wait times (in minutes) are:  

10, 15, 15, 20, 30, 35, 40, 50, 60  

- Mean (Average wait time):  
  Mean = (10+15+15+20+30+35+40+50+60) / 9 = 30.5 minutes  
- Median (Middle value): 30 minutes  
- Mode (Most common value): 15 minutes

6. Standard Deviation – Measuring Variability in Hospital Wait Times  
Standard deviation tells us how spread out the wait times are. Suppose we have these wait times (in minutes):  

10, 15, 15, 20, 30, 35, 40, 50, 60  

- Mean (Average) = 30.5 minutes  
- Standard Deviation (σ) = Measures how much individual wait times differ from the mean.  

If σ = 15 minutes, then:  
- Most patients wait between 15.5 minutes and 45.5 minutes.  
- A low σ means most patients wait close to 30.5 minutes.  
- A high σ means patients experience very different wait times.  

Visualization:

7. Variance – Understanding Patient Recovery Time Spread  
Variance is the square of standard deviation and shows how spread out recovery times are.  

If we track recovery times (in days) for COVID-19 patients:  
- Patient 1: 7 days  
- Patient 2: 10 days  
- Patient 3: 14 days  
- Patient 4: 20 days  
- Patient 5: 30 days  

Variance helps determine if recovery times are predictable or not.

8. Confidence Interval – Predicting Average Hospital Stay  
A hospital wants to estimate the average length of stay for COVID-19 patients.  
- A sample of 50 patients has an average stay of 8 days.  
- The standard deviation is 2 days.  
- Using a 95% confidence interval, we calculate:  

Margin of Error = Z × (σ / sqrt(n))

With a Z-score of 1.96, the 95% confidence interval might be:  

(7.5, 8.5)

This means the hospital is 95% confident that the true average stay is between 7.5 to 8.5 days.  

Visualization:  
A normal distribution curve showing the confidence interval around 8 days.

9. Regression – Predicting Heart Disease Risk Based on BMI  
Linear regression helps us predict health risks. Suppose we analyze BMI (Body Mass Index) vs. Heart Disease Cases:  

Equation:  

Heart Disease Risk = 0.5 × BMI + 5  

If a patient has a BMI of 30, their predicted heart disease risk is:  

0.5(30) + 5 = 20%

Visualization:  
A scatter plot with BMI on the x-axis and Heart Disease Risk on the y-axis, with a trend line showing the relationship.

10. Hypothesis Testing – Does a New Drug Reduce Hospital Stay?  
A hospital tests a new drug for COVID-19 recovery.  

- Null Hypothesis (H₀): The drug does NOT reduce hospital stay.  
- Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): The drug reduces hospital stay.  

A study compares 100 patients:  
- 50 took the drug (average stay = 6 days).  
- 50 did not take the drug (average stay = 8 days).  

Using a t-test, if p-value < 0.05, we reject H₀ and conclude the drug is effective.
