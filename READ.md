üîç Deep Learning
A subfield of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers (hence "deep") to learn from large amounts of data. It's particularly effective for tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

üß† Neural Network Layers
Input Layer
The first layer of the network that receives the raw input data (e.g., image pixels, text tokens, etc.).

Hidden Layer
Intermediate layers between input and output. These perform computations via weighted connections and activation functions to extract features or patterns.

Output Layer
The final layer that produces the prediction or classification result. The number of neurons here corresponds to the number of target classes or output values.

üß∞ Popular Frameworks
PyTorch
An open-source deep learning framework developed by Facebook. It's widely used in research and known for its flexibility and dynamic computation graphs.

TensorFlow
Developed by Google, it's a robust, production-ready framework that supports both high-level (via Keras) and low-level operations for building deep learning models.
