education in educational leadership december copyright by vickie a kelly ii clinical research study committee major advisor iii abstract since distance education was first introduced in higher education there has been controversy attached to whether it is as effective as facetoface instruction the explosion of internetdriven instruction has only accelerated the discussion this study was undertaken in a midwestern university technology administration program a bachelors degree completion program for students with an existing occupationally oriented associate degree eighthundred eightyfive students were identified for the sample a twofactor anova was used to answer the first research question is there is a statistically significant difference between students grades in online classes and traditional facetoface classes results showed no significant difference between the grades of online and facetoface students chisquare analysis was used for research question is there a statistically significant difference between course retention in online classes and traditional facetoface classes no significant difference was found between course retention in online classes and facetoface classes last research question was answered utilizing chisquare analysis research question was is there a statistically significant difference between program retention for students entering the program enrolled in online classes and students entering the program enrolled in traditional facetoface classes the data showed no significant difference in course retention of students who began the program in online courses and students who began in facetoface courses implications for further action include recommendations for expansion of online courses and programs supported by the research data analysis of existing data of other online courses and programs is recommended recommendations for further research included analyzing different delivery variations and continued

physical presence of professors and students in the same location knowles from with the founding of harvard university the harvard guide to the development of junior colleges and vocational schools in the early s cohen brawer jacobs grubb the higher education system developed to prepare posthigh school students for one of three separate tiers the college and university system in the united states developed its own set of structures designed to prepare students for baccalaureate and graduate degrees junior colleges were limited to associate degrees while vocational education institutions offered occupational certificates in many cases there was inadequate recognition of the postsecondary education offered at junior colleges and vocational education institutions resulting in the inability of students to transfer to year institutions national center for education statistics in the midth century some junior colleges began to provide academic vocational and personal development educational offerings for members of the local communities during this same period junior or community colleges developed a role as transfer institutions for students who because of time preparedness economics or distance could not begin their postsecondary education at a year institution cohen brawer until the mids the majority of transfer programs involved associate of arts aa and associate of science as degrees associate of applied science aas degrees were developed during the s the aas degree was granted to those who successfully completed the majority of their college program in vocational education the creation of a variety of applied baccalaureate degrees allowed students who had previously thought of the aas degree as a terminal program to complete a baccalaureate degree kansas board of regents online education also became a strategy for students to access higher education in the s allen seaman b the proliferation of online courses alleviated some of the locationbound barriers to higher education but online education was criticized as less rigorous than traditional classroombased course work by traditional academicians russell attempted to address this argument with his metaanalysis of studies dating from the s and covering multiple delivery models including online education russell concluded there was no statistically significant difference in student achievement between courses offered online and those offered in the traditional classroom setting since the development of correspondence courses in the s researchers have attempted to ascertain if students participating in distance education are being shortchanged in their educational goals no significant difference in grades has been found in the majority of studies designed to address this issue studies analyzing online student retention have shown significantly lower retention for online students in the last years research studies have expanded to include variations of online education these include strictly online hybrid courses webassisted classroom settings and the traditional higher education course offered only as facetoface instruction carmel gold online education continues to proliferate at the same time the number of secondary students in the united states overall is projected to increase national center for education statistics nces the projected increase of potential postsecondary students and online postsecondary options provides opportunities for increases in online education programs and courses in nces reported that over of students in higher education were participating in online courses in a study allen and seaman estimated only of those enrolled in online education courses are undergraduate students seeking their first degree counter to the projected increase in traditionalage students the majority of enrollees in online education are adults updating or advancing their credentials creating an additional educational market for colleges and universities seeking to expand enrollment without adding physical space allen seaman a for states and localities faced with a contradictory traditionalage enrollment decrease these figures present an untapped market for higher education courses and programs background researchers attempted to analyze the efficacy of distance education as far back as the s when correspondence courses were created to meet the need of students not willing to attend a traditional classroombased higher education setting a metaanalysis of these studies resulted in the no significant difference phenomenon reported by russell the results of over studies were compiled comparing various modes of delivery including correspondence audio television courses and the newest wave of computerfacilitated instruction following analyses of studies completed prior to russell concluded there was no difference in learning between students enrolled in distance education and those completing courses in the traditional setting studies completed since then have provided mixed results summers waigand and whittaker found there was no difference in gpa and retention between the online and traditional classroom arle found higher achievement by online students and brown and liedholm found gpa and student retention better in a traditional classroom setting student retention is an integral part of the student achievement conversation and is an issue for all forms of higher education degreeseeking students overall retention has been reported as less than by nces long considered a problem in higher education attention to the distance education model has shown even lower retention rates in online students than in students attending at the traditional college setting phipps meristosis research on different modalities such as fully online and hybrid online courses has produced mixed results carmel gold no significant trend toward increased retention of students in any of the online modalities has been documented retention studies of transfer students have primarily included traditionally defined students transfering from a community college statistics have consistantly shown a lower retention rate for students transfering from a community college to a year university than for students who began their posthigh school education at a year institution nces townsends studies of transfer students at the university of missouricolumbia also showed a lower baccalaureate retention rate for students who had completed an aas degree than for students beginning their education at a year institution townsend occupationally oriented bachelors degree completion programs are relatively new to higher education transfer programs in the liberal arts from community colleges to year institutions were common by the s townsend in her study conducted at the university of missouricolumbia observed the blurring of the lines between nontransferrable occupationally oriented undergraduate degrees and undergraduate degrees and certificates that were easily transferred the study conducted by townsend was among the first to recognize that many students who began their education at community and technical colleges had bachelors degree aspirations that grew after their completion of an occupationallyoriented degree laanan proposed that the increase in institutions offering aas degrees necessitated new ways to transfer undergraduate credits the setting of this study is a mediumsized midwestern campus located in topeka kansas washburn university enrolls approximately students a year in undergraduate and graduate programs including liberal arts professional schools and a law school washburn university the technology administration ta program selected for the present study began in the s as a baccalaureate degree completion program for students who had received an occupationally oriented associate degree at a kansas community college or through washburns articulation agreement with kansas vocationaltechnical schools this program provided students who previously had obtained an associate of applied science degree in an occupational area an opportunity to earn a bachelors degree peterson dean of continuing education washburn university stated that in early washburn university began online courses and programs at the behest of a neighboring community college personal communication april washburn was asked to develop an online bachelors degree completion program for students graduating from community colleges and technical colleges with an associate of applied science degree the ta program was among the first programs to offer the online bachelors degree completion option the ta program offered its first online courses in spring online education at washburn expanded to other programs and courses to include over courses washburn university the original online partnership with two community colleges expanded to include additional community colleges and four technical colleges in kansas as well as colleges in missouri california wisconsin south carolina and nebraska washburn university an initial study in of students course grades and retention in online courses offered at washburn showed no significant difference between students enrolled in online courses and students enrolled in traditional facetoface course work peterson personal communication april no studies of program retention have been completed in atkins reported overall enrollment at washburn university decreased from fall to fall from to students during the same period online course enrollment patterns increased from students to in washburn university atkins also reported that between and the ratio of traditional posthigh school age students to nontraditional students enrolling at washburn university reversed from to the shift in enrollment patterns produced an increase in enrollment in the early part of the st century however washburn university anticipated a decrease in high school graduates in kansas through based on demographic patterns of the state the state figures are opposite the anticipated increase of traditionalage students nationally nces the increase in distance education students in relation to the anticipated decline in traditionalage students provided the focus for the study purpose of the study online education has become an important strategy for the higher education institution that was the setting of this study first the purpose of the study was to determine if there was a significant difference between the course grades of students participating in ta online courses and their traditional classroombased counterparts the second purpose of the study was to determine if there was a significant difference between course retention of students participating in ta online courses and their traditional classroombased counterparts the second part of the study was a replication of studies comparing modes of online course delivery to traditional classroombased instruction carmel gold russell a third purpose of the study was to determine if there was a significant difference between program retention of students who began the ta program in online courses and those who began the program enrolled in traditional facetoface courses the studys purpose was to expand the knowledge base concerning online education to include its efficacy in providing baccalaureate degree completion opportunities research questions roberts stated research questions guide the study and usually provide the structure for presenting the results of the research the research questions guiding this study were is there is a statistically significant difference between students grades in online classes and traditional facetoface classes is there a statistically significant difference between course retention rates in online classes and traditional facetoface classes is there a statistically significant difference between program retention for students entering the program enrolled in online classes and students entering the program enrolled in traditional facetoface classes overview of the methodology a quantitative study was utilized to compare grades by course course retention and program retention of students enrolled in the online and traditional facetoface ta program at washburn university archival data from the student system at washburn university were utilized from comparative online and traditional facetoface classes in two separate courses in order to answer research question a sample of students enrolled in online and traditional facetoface courses was identified the sample included students entering the program in the fall semesters of and in both the online and traditional facetoface classes two instructors were responsible for concurrent instruction of both the online and facetoface classes for the period analyzed a twofactor analysis of variance was used to analyze for the potential difference in the dependent variables course grades due to delivery method online and facetoface instructor instructors a and b and the potential interaction between the two independent variables research question a chisquare test for differences among proportions was used to analyze course and program retention research questions and delimitations roberts defined delimitations as the boundaries of the study that are controlled principally by the researcher the delimitations for this study were only data from through from technology administration online and facetoface courses were utilized the study was confined to students enrolled at washburn university in the technology administration program only grades and retention were analyzed assumptions assumptions are defined as those things presupposed in a study roberts the study was based on the following assumptions delivery of content was consistent between online and facetoface courses and instructors course objectives were the same for paired online and traditional faceto face courses all students enrolled in the ta program met the same criteria for admission to the university all data entered in the excel spreadsheets were correct all students enrolled in the ta program met the same criteria for grade point average and program prerequisites definitions the following terms are defined for the purpose of this study distance education education or training courses delivered to remote locations via postal delivery or broadcast by audio video or computer technologies allen dropout a dropout is defined as a student who has left school and discontinued studies merriamwebsters collegiate dictionary facetoface delivery this is a course that uses no online technology content is delivered in person either in written or oral form allen hybrid course this course is a blend of the online and facetoface course a substantial proportion of the content is delivered online typically using some online discussions and some facetoface meetings allen online course this defines a course where most or all of the content is delivered online via computer technologies typically there are no facetoface meetings allen plan the partnership for learning and networking is a collaborative set of online baccalaureate degree programs developed by washburn university the programs require completion of an associate degree from one of the partner community or technical colleges washburn university retention this term refers to the completion of a course by receiving a letter grade in a course or a certificate of completion or degree for program completion washburn university webassisted a course that uses webbased technology to facilitate what is essentially a facetoface course allen organization of the study this study consists of five chapters chapter one introduced the role of distance education in higher education chapter one included the background of the study the research questions overview of the methodology the delimitations of the study and the definition of terms chapter two presents a literature review which includes the history of occupational postsecondary education distance education and studies relating to grades and retention of students involved in distance education chapter three describes the methodology used for the research study it includes the selection of participants design data collection and statistical procedures of the study chapter four presents the findings of the research study finally chapter five provides a discussion of the results conclusions and implications for further research and practice chapter two literature review this chapter presents the background for research into the efficacy of distance education in the delivery of higher education research studies have focused primarily on grades as a measure of the quality of distance education courses as compared to traditional facetoface instruction utilizing grades has produced a dividing line among education researchers concerning the use of distance education as a delivery model retention in distance education has focused primarily on single courses with little program retention data available data from retention studies in higher education have focused primarily on the traditional year university student retention studies of community college students have produced quantitative results however these studies have been directed at community college students who identify themselves as transfer students early in their community college careers retention studies of students enrolled in occupationally oriented programs are limited statistical data of higher education shows an increased use of distance education for traditional academic courses as well as occupationally oriented courses the increase in distance education courses and programs has provided a new dimension to studies of both grades and retention the recognition of this increase as well as questions concerning its impact on student learning and retention produced the impetus for this study the following review of the literature represents the literature related to this research study through examination of previous research the direction of the present study was formulated specifically the chapter is organized into four sections a the history of occupational transfer programs b the history and research of distance education including occupational transfer programs utilizing distance education c research utilizing grades as an indicator of student learning in online education and d research focusing on student retention in higher education including student retention issues in transfer education and online transfer courses and programs history of occupational transfer programs the measure of success in higher education has been characterized as the attainment of a bachelors degree at a year university occupationally oriented education was considered primarily a function of job preparation and until the s was not considered transferrable to other higher education institutions occupational transfer programs are a recent occurrence within the postsecondary system that provides an additional pathway to bachelors degree completion historically the postsecondary experience in the united states developed as a threetrack system colleges were established in the united states in with the founding of harvard college the harvard guide junior colleges were first founded in as experimental posthigh school graduate programs joliet junior college history their role was initially as a transfer institution to the university when the smithhughes act was passed in a system of vocational education was born in the united states jacobs grubb and was designed to provide further education to those students not viewed as capable of success in a university setting vocational education currently referred to as occupational or technical education was not originally designed to be a path to higher education the first programs were designed to help agricultural workers complete their education and increase their skills more vocational programs were developed during the early th century as industrialization developed and as increasing numbers of skills were needed by workers in bluecollar occupations jacobs grubb in the midth century some junior colleges expanded their programs beyond academic selections to provide occupational development and continuing education because of the geographic area from which they attracted students junior colleges developed a role as community colleges they also solidified their role as transfer institutions for students who because of time preparedness economics or distance could not begin their postsecondary education at a year institution cohen brawer until the mids the majority of transfer programs to year universities involved traditional academic degrees including the associate of arts aa and associate of science as degrees occupational programs and continuing education were viewed as terminal and nontransferrable in congress authorized the carl perkins vocational and technical education act pl in the legislation congress responded to employers concerns about the lack of basic skills in employees by adding academic requirements to vocational education legislation vocational program curriculum was expanded to include language arts mathematics and science principles and the curriculum reflected the context of the program the secretarys commission on achieving necessary skills scans was created in to determine the skills young people need to succeed in the world of work us department of labor in the second carl perkins reauthorization in pl congress responded to the report which targeted academic and job skills by outlining a seamless system of vocational and academic education to prepare vocational students to progress into and through higher education this emphasis led to the development of associate of applied science aas degrees during the s granted to those who have successfully completed programs in the applied arts and sciences for careers aas degrees were seen as terminal kansas board of regents but as one goal was attained conversation turned to creating a pathway from occupational associate degrees to bachelors degree completion the desire of students to continue from technical degrees to a baccalaureate was not a new idea in a paper presented in to the american technical association national conference troutt ervin and morgans overview of programs showed acceptance of aas degrees at traditional universities was generally nonexistent their suggestion for an academic bridge from early technical education to baccalaureate programs highlighted programs accepting aas degrees toward baccalaureate completion were an exception rather than a rule trouttervin morgan it was not until the late s that applied baccalaureate degrees recognized credits from technical degree students who had previously thought of themselves in a terminal program to complete their baccalaureate degree wellman despite the advance of recognition of aas degrees standard definitions of transfer students continued to exclude students who completed technical programs the us department of education did not include students receiving an associate of applied science degree in the definition of students preparing for transfer to year colleges bradburn hurst peng carnevale most states had comparable policies in place concerning core academic curriculum articulation agreements transfer of credit and statewide transfer guides there was no general recognition of occupational credit transfer only a few states including kansas missouri and washington allowed credits earned in occupationally oriented degrees to transfer to year institutions townsend no state had set clear goals for the transference of occupational credits between institutions or for the state as a whole wellman despite the lack of recognition of occupational transfer credit at the federal level a new definition of transfer education had emerged initially defined as the general education component of the first years of a baccalaureate the definition of transfer education now included any courses that transferred to a year college regardless of the nature of the courses townsend the line between vocational schools community colleges and year institutions blurred in the united states as employers and students increasingly made business decisions regarding education and workforce development employers increasingly asked for employees with academic and technical skills as well as critical thinking skills and personal responsibility us department of labor returning students themselves were more attuned to the demands of the st century workforce their desire to return to higher education coupled with the economy and the variety of options available to them required a more adaptive higher education system carnevale there was growing demand among new and returning students for higher education opportunities responsive to their needs the expanding needs of the returning student provided opportunities for higher education to respond by utilizing different delivery models distance education online education became a strategy for postsecondary institutions when the first correspondence courses were initiated with the mail service in the early th century russell as various technologies emerged distance education utilized television and video models in addition to paperbased correspondence courses the expansion of distance education utilizing computer technologies renewed academic debate over the efficacy of the delivery model online education utilizing the internet became a significant factor in the s prompting renewed evaluation of the use of distance learning opportunities russell phipps meristosis in the number of students who took any distance education courses was of total undergraduates enrolled in postsecondary education nces in the report of the webbased education commission to the president and congress concluded that the internet was no longer in question as a tool to transform the way teaching and learning was offered the commission recommended that the nation embrace elearning as a strategy to provide ondemand highquality teaching and professional development to keep the united states competitive in the global workforce they also recommended continued funding of research into teaching and learning utilizing webbased resources webbased education commission the acceptance of the importance of the internet for delivery of higher education opened new opportunities for research and continued the academic debate of the quality of instruction delivered in online education courses and programs in a longitudinal study from the sloan consortium a group of higher education institutions actively involved in online education began studies of online education in the united states over a period of years in the first study researchers allen and seaman conducted polls of postsecondary institutions involved with online education and found that students overwhelming responded to the availability of online education with over million students taking at least one online course during the fall semester of over one third of these students took all of their courses online the survey also found that in of all institutions of higher education offered at least one fully online or blended course allen seaman in their intermediate report in allen and seaman postulated that online education had continued to make inroads in postsecondary education with of schools offering graduate courses and programs facetoface also offering graduate courses online sixtythree percent of undergraduate institutions offering facetoface courses also offered courses online from to the survey results showed that online education as a longterm strategy for institutions had increased from to in addition core education online course offerings had increased allen seaman in allen and seamans final report b for the sloan consortium the researchers reported that almost million students participated in at least one online course during the fall term a nearly increase over the number reported in the previous year allen and seaman also reported a increase in online enrollment compared to the growth in overall higher education they found by year institutions had the highest growth rates and accounted for over the half the online enrollments in the previous years the researchers concluded based on a survey conducted as part of the research institutions believed that improved student access was the top reason for offering online courses and programs allen seaman b community colleges began embracing distance education in the s as part of their mission to provide lowcost timeeffective education community colleges initially provided correspondence courses by mail but later switched to television and video courses as technology improved cohen brawer in over of public year colleges in the united states provided distance education courses over the internet nces vocational education by the nature of its instructional format was among the last of the educational institutions to participate in distance education because of the kinesthetic nature of instruction vocational education leaders began investigating distance education opportunities in the s relying on the method to provide only the lecture portion of instruction by only of students enrolled in vocational schools had participated in some form of distance education during their program of study nces in handson instruction in programs such as automobile mechanics and welding and the clinical portion of health occupations programs continued to be taught in the traditional classroom setting nces analysis of data reported by the nces indicated that distance education had become a staple for higher education institutions at both the year and year university level over of institutions offered more than million courses in by distance education while vocational education had traditionally been more handson distance education had become more prevalent in providing opportunities for students to participate in components of the system over the internet nces distance education became the prevalent strategy for higher education institutions to expand their services to new and returning students without the financial implications of capital expansion higher education utilized the strategy to market to students outside their traditional geographic reach by utilizing the power of the internet the increasing demand from students of all ages for online opportunities provided new ground for the expansion of higher education opportunities grades as an indicator of quality of student learning the grading system in the united states educational system has served as an indicator of knowledge for over years educators have utilized high school grades as a sorting mechanism in american schools to determine postsecondary opportunities modern society has accepted honors attainment graduation honors and course grades as an indicator of knowledge acquisition in postsecondary education stray reported that the use of grading in schools can be traced to the industrial revolution and the development of factories william farish of cambridge university developed the first grading system in higher education in stray farish mimicked the system established by factories of the time grade a being the best the thought was that farish employed the grading system in order to teach more students an aberration at that time when instructors rarely had more than a few the demand for more higher education opportunities prompted farish to open his class to more students and as such led to his use of a sorting system this was the first known record of grading utilized in classrooms to measure student achievement stray smallwood reported the first grading in higher education at yale university in stiles president of yale university directed the use of the scale in the late th century however smallwood noted it was not until that any record of grades or marking appeared using a scale of philosophy and mathematic professors instituted the first use of a marking instrument in the s at harvard smallwood noted early systems were experimental utilizing different numerical scales with no standardized system in place between higher education institutions it was not until the late s that faculty began using descriptors such as a and b to rank students according to a predetermined numerical scale smallwood experimentation with evaluation of achievement continued into the early th century when educational psychologists including dewey and thorndike attempted to compare grading scales with intelligence testing thorndikes philosophy of standardized testing and grading survived the th century and his quote whatever exists at all exists in some amount thorndike as cited in ebel frisbie p has been utilized in educational measurement textbooks as a validation of the use of standards of measurement to measure achievement ebel frisbie the use of grades expanded to community colleges high schools and elementary schools in the early s pressey the use of grades throughout the educational system is fairly standardized today with the scale it is this standardization that allows comparison of grades as achievement between educational levels and institutions ebel frisbie and allows grades to be utilized as a measure for comparison of educational achievement researchers analyzing the success of community college transfer students have traditionally studied the grades of the traditional transfer student with an aa or as degree keeley and houses study of sophomore and junior transfer students at northern illinois university analyzed transfer shock p for students matriculating from community colleges the researchers found students who transferred from a community college obtained a grade point average significantly lower in their first semester than did students who began their college career at a year institution however the results of the longitudinal studies showed that transfer students who persisted to graduation showed an equivalent gpa at baccalaureate completion keeley house students who transferred from occupationally oriented degree programs typically were not included in traditional studies of transfer students while the research in general does not include aas students in traditional transfer data limited conclusions were available comparing aas students to traditional year college attendees townsends study at the university of missouricolumbia showed no difference in grades at baccalaureate graduation between students with an aaas degree and students with an aas degree the use of grades as an indicator of the level of student achievement has been relied upon by studies comparing traditional classroom instruction and distance instruction research analyzing the effectiveness of student learning in distance education began with the first correspondence courses offered utilizing the mail service russell the study of effectiveness of correspondence courses expanded to include new technologies such as television and video courses and increased with the proliferation of online educational offerings researchers continued to challenge the effectiveness of learning methods not delivered in traditional higher education settings in russell reviewed over studies dating from the s and continuing through the late s and found no significant difference in student learning using any form of distance education as compared with students in classroombased instruction russell russells conclusion formed the basis for a series of works collectively known as no significant difference russells conclusion from his studies follows the fact is the findings of comparative studies are absolutely conclusive one can bank on them no matter how it is produced how it is delivered whether or not it is interactive low tech or high tech students learn equally well with each technology and learn as well as their oncampus facetoface counterparts even though students would rather be on campus with the instructor if that were a real choice p xviii overwhelmingly studies have supported russells conclusions including neuhausers study of traditional facetoface education and online education in a business communications class at a large urban university in north carolina neuhauser concluded there was no significant difference in pre and posttest scores of students enrolled in online and traditional communications classes in addition neuhauser found no significant difference in final grades homework grades and grades on research papers even though learners in the online course were significantly older than were learners in the traditional facetoface section the summers et al research included a comparison of student achievement and satisfaction in an online versus a traditional facetoface statistics class the study conducted at the university of missouricolumbia included undergraduate nursing students who were tested on both their pre and postcourse knowledge of statistics their results indicated that utilizing grades as an indicator of knowledge showed no significant difference between the online and traditional classroom students in their metaanalysis machtmes and asher reviewed studies and concluded there did not appear to be a difference in achievement as measured by grades between distance and traditional learners as technology use continued to evolve in online education various studies were conducted to determine whether different delivery methods created a difference in the grades of online students compared to their facetoface counterparts a study conducted by carmel and gold supported russells original conclusion by analyzing specific types of online platforms and delivery models carmel and golds study included hybrid and traditional classroombased instruction they analyzed results from students in courses and found no significant difference in student achievement based on grades between students enrolled in either delivery method additional studies supporting russells theory have crossed multiple content areas and delivery models brown and liedholms study at michigan state university included microeconomics students in virtual hybrid and traditional classroombased instruction the study included students in the traditional setting in the hybrid delivery section and students enrolled in online education no significant difference in student learning as measured by end of course grades was found research also showed type of course discipline is not affected by the online delivery model schulman and simms compared pretest and posttest scores of students enrolled in an online course and a traditional course at nova southeastern university the researchers compared undergraduate students enrolled in online courses and undergraduate students enrolled in the classroom setting of the same course results indicated that the students who select online courses scored higher than traditional students scored on the pretest results however posttest results showed no significant difference for the online students versus the inclass students schulman and simms concluded that online students were learning equally as well as their classroom based counterparts reigles analysis across disciplines at the university of san francisco and the university of california found no significant difference between online and facetoface student grade attainment shachar and neumann conducted a metaanalysis that estimated and compared the differences between the academic performance of students enrolled in distance education compared to those enrolled in traditional settings over the period from eightysix studies containing data from over participating students were included in their analysis the results of the metaanalysis showed that in twothirds of the cases students taking courses by distance education outperformed their student counterparts enrolled in traditionally instructed courses lynch during the use of the tegrity system a brandspecific online platform at louisiana state university found that students grades were slightly better after utilizing the technology than when the traditional approach was used lynch initial results of a university of wisconsinmilwaukee study of students over years indicated that the upace online students performed better than their traditional psychology counterparts on the same cumulative test perez arles study found students enrolled in online human anatomy courses at rio salado college scored an average of higher on assessments than the national achievement average students were assessed using a national standardized test generated by the human anatomy and physiology society whose norming sample is based entirely on traditional classroom delivery arle in a study conducted by stephenson brown and griffin comparing three different delivery styles traditional asynchronous electronic courseware and synchronous electures results indicated no increased effectiveness of any delivery style when all question types were taken into account however when results were analyzed students receiving traditional lectures showed the lowest levels on questions designed to assess comprehension research found supporters in higher education academic leaders in a survey of midwestern postsecondary institutions concerning their online offerings of academic leaders in the states rated the learning outcomes in online education as the same or superior to those in facetoface instructional settings the proportion of higher education institutions believing that online learning outcomes were superior to those for facetoface outcomes was still relatively small but had grown by since from to allen seaman b this belief added merit to the conclusions supported by russell and others russells no significant difference conclusion had its detractors the most commonly cited is phipps and merisotis who reviewed russells original metaanalysis and reported a much different conclusion they concluded that the overall quality of the original research was questionable that much of the research did not control for extraneous variables and therefore it could not show cause and effect they included in their findings evidence that the studies utilized by russell in the metaanalysis did not use randomly selected subjects did not take into effect the differences among students and did not include tests of validity and reliability the phipps and merisotis analysis included the conclusion that research has focused too much on individual courses rather than on academic programs and has not taken into account differences among students they postulated that based on these conclusions there is a significant difference in the learning results as evidenced by grades of students participating in distance education as compared to their classroom based peers their analysis of russells original work questioned both the quality and effectiveness of research comparing distance and traditional education delivery while there has been ongoing conjecture that online education students are not receiving an equivalent learning experience compared to their traditional classroom counterparts studies utilizing grades as an indicator of student learning have produced little evidence of the disparity the incidence of studies showing significant negative differences in grades of online learners is small higher education institutions have indicated their support for online education and its continued growth has allowed studies such as the present research to contribute to ongoing dialogue student retention in postsecondary education persistence and retention in higher education is an issue that has intrigued researchers for over years quantitative studies conducted in the midth century produced data that caused researchers to look at low retention rates in higher education and search for answers this question has continued to consume researchers and higher education institutions in tinto attempted to summarize studies of individual student retention in higher education by proposing a theory to allow higher education administrators to predict success and support students tinto tintos model of student engagement has been in use for over years as higher education administrators and faculty attempt to explain student retention issues at universities and colleges tintos model primarily focused on factors of student engagement how students respond to instructors the higher education community itself and students own engagement in learning are the primary factors tinto theorized as determining the students retention in the concluding remarks to his treatise on retention tinto acknowledged that persistence in higher education is but one facet of human growth and development and one that can not necessarily be attributed to a single factor or strategy tintos original study of student retention included the observation that student retention is a complicated web of events that shape student leaving and persistence he observed that the view of student retention had changed since the s when students were thought to leave due to lack of motivation persistence and skills hence the name dropout in the s research began to focus on the role of the environment in student decisions to stay or leave in the s tinto proposed that the actions of the faculty were the key to institutional efforts to enhance student retention tinto this was a significant addition to his theory placing the cause on the instructor instead of the student and it has done much to influence retention strategies utilized in higher education institutions tinto tintos studies have driven research in both traditional retention studies and those involving distance education studies of the persistence of the postsecondary student routinely focus on year postsecondary education it is only within the last years that persistence studies have included community college students and occupational students acknowledging that their reasons for entering the postsecondary community are different from the traditional year higher education participant cohen brawer with different avenues to a baccalaureate degree more prevalent the research into college persistence has expanded to include other types of programs and students postsecondary student retention rates routinely utilize data from longitudinal studies of students entering in a fall semester and completing a bachelors program no more than years later nces the national center for education statistics reported that of those seeking a baccalaureate degree would complete in years nces the report acknowledged institutions are unable to follow students who transfer to other institutions they are able to report only the absence of enrollment in their own institution research has also found a large gap between community college entrants and year college entrants in rates of attaining a bachelors degree dougherty reported that students entering community college receive to fewer bachelors degrees than students beginning at a year university dougherty postulated that the lower baccalaureate attainment rate of community college entrants was attributable to both their individual traits and the institution they entered dougherty studies of student retention of community college also vary based on the types of students community college retention rates are routinely reported as lower than traditional year institutions nces cohen and brawer attributed the differences in retention to the difference in the mission in many instances students did not enroll in a community college in order to attain a degree cohen brawer the most recent longitudinal study in showed a retention rate of of students after years nces of community college students only indicated a desire to transfer later to a baccalaureate degree completion program nces while retention data collected by the federal government nces did not include students with an aas degree townsends studies of the transfer rates and baccalaureate attainment rates of students in missouri who had completed an associate of arts and students who had completed an associate of applied science degree was compared to townsend vocational or occupational programs have reported retention rates as program completion a definition involving completion of specific tasks and competencies instead of grades and tied to a limited program length this state and federal requirement indicates program quality and ensures continued federal funding in the us department of education reported a completion rate of postsecondary students enrolled in occupational education nces until the reasons for students leaving was neither delineated nor reported it was not until federal reporting requirements under the carl perkins act of that institutions were required to explore why students were not retained in vocational programs pl distance education provided a new arena for the study of student persistence theorists and researchers have attempted to utilize tintos model of student persistence to explain retention issues involved with distance education however rovai analyzed the differing student characteristics of distance learners as compared to the traditional students targeted by tintos original models and concluded that student retention theories proposed from that population were no longer applicable to distance education learners rovai proposed that distance educators could address retention in ways that traditional higher education has not he suggested that distance educators utilize strategies such as capitalizing on students expectations of technology addressing economic benefits and specific educational needs to increase student retention in courses rovai the expanded use of technology created a distinct subset of research into student retention issues in berge and huang developed an overview of models of student retention with special emphasis on models developed to explain the retention rates in distance education their studies primarily focused on the variables in student demographics and external factors such as age and gender which influence persistence and retention in online learning berge and huang found that traditional models of student retention such as tintos did not acknowledge the differences in student expectations and goals that are ingrained in the students selection of the online learning option other researchers have attempted to study retention issues specifically for online education in a metaanalysis nora and snyder found the majority of studies of online education focused on students individual characteristics and individual perceptions of technology nora and snyder concluded that researchers attempt to utilize traditional models of student engagement to explain student retention issues in distance or online learning courses with little or no success this supported berge and huards conclusions nora and snyder also noted a dearth of quantitative research few quantitative studies exist that support higher or equal retention in online students compared to their classroombased counterparts one example is the carmel and gold study they found no significant difference in student retention rates between students in distance education courses and their traditional classroombased counterparts the study utilized data from students enrolled in classroombased courses and enrolled in a hybrid online format participants randomly selfselected and were not all enrolled in the same course introducing variables not attributed in the study the majority of quantitative studies instead concluded there is a higher retention rate in traditional classrooms than in distance education in the phipps and merisotis review of russells original research which included online education results indicated that research has shown even lower retention rates in online students than in students attending classes in the traditional college setting the high dropout rate among distance education students was not addressed in russells metaanalysis and phipps and merisotis found no suitable explanation in the research they postulated that the decreased retention rate documented within distance education studies skews achievement data by excluding the dropouts diaz found a high drop rate for online students compared to traditional classroombased students in an online health education course at nova southeastern other studies have supported the theory that retention of online students is far below that of the traditional campus students in carr reporting for the chronicle of higher education noted that online courses routinely lose of students who originally enrolled as compared to a retention rate of of traditional facetoface students carr reported dropout rates of up to in online courses as a likely indicator of the difficultly faced in retaining distance education students who do not routinely meet with faculty the data have not been refuted as community colleges began utilizing distance education retention rates were reported as higher than traditional students nash however the california community college system report for fall courses showed inconsistent retention results for distance education learners varying by the type of course results indicated equivalent retention rates for online instruction compared to traditional coursework in the majority of courses lower retention rates were indicated in online engineering social sciences and mathematics courses as compared to traditional classroom instructional models california community colleges chancellors office due to the limited number of vocationaltechnical or occupational courses taught in the online mode there was little data on student retention in hogan studied technical course and program completion of students in distance and traditional vocational education and found that course completion rates were higher for distance education students however program completion rates were higher for traditional students than for students enrolled in distance education hogan in summary studies of retention have focused primarily on student characteristics while acknowledging that postsecondary retention rates vary according to a variety of factors research showed mixed results concerning the retention rate of online students though quantitative data leans heavily toward a lower course retention rate in online students data from year universities have shown lower retention rates for online students than for traditional facetoface students while community colleges have shown inconsistent results data from vocationaltechnical education has been limited but course retention rates are higher for online students while program retention rates are lower no significant research factor affecting retention has been isolated between students in online baccalaureate completion programs and students participating in traditional classroombased settings summary research studies have been conducted analyzing student retention in higher education transfer and retention of students from community colleges to universities the impact of distance education and student achievement and retention factors related to distance education however no comparative research was identified that compared the achievement and retention of students participating in an occupationally oriented transfer program utilizing both online education and traditional classroombased instruction chapter three addresses the topics of research design hypotheses and research questions additionally population and sample data collection and data analysis are discussed chapter three methodology the purpose of this study was to determine if there is a significant difference between course grades of students enrolled in online technology administration courses and their traditional classroombased counterparts the study also examined if there is a significant difference between course retention and program retention of students enrolled in online technology administration courses and their traditional classroom based counterparts the methodology employed to test the research hypotheses is presented in this chapter the chapter is organized into the following sections research design hypotheses and research questions population and sample data collection data analysis and summary research design a quantitative quasiexperimental research design was selected to study grades course retention and program retention in students enrolled in the technology administration program the design was chosen as a means to determine if significant differences occur between online and facetoface students by examining numerical scores from all participants enrolled and retention rates in both courses and programs in the technology administration program hypotheses and research questions this study focused on three research questions with accompanying hypotheses the research questions and hypotheses guiding the study follow research question is there is a statistically significant difference between students grades in online classes and traditional facetoface classes h there is a statistically significant difference in course grades of students participating in online courses and students enrolled in a traditional classroom setting at the level of significance research question is there a statistically significant difference between course retention rate of students in online classes and traditional facetoface classes h there is a statistically significant difference in student course retention between students participating in online courses and students enrolled in facetoface courses at the level of significance research question is there a statistically significant difference in program retention between students who entered the program in online classes and students who entered the program in traditional facetoface classes h there is a statistically significant difference in program retention between students who begin the technology administration program in online courses and students who begin in facetoface courses at the level of significance population and sample the two populations selected were students enrolled in online and facetoface courses the sample included students enrolled in technology administration courses student enrollment was analyzed for all technology administration courses in the program sequence to determine the number of samples available in online and faceto face classes the course enrollment

student names were removed data collection an institutional review board irb form was prepared for washburn university approval prior to data collection the study was designated as an exempt study the washburn university irb form is provided in appendix a approval of the irb was transmitted by email a copy is located in appendix b in addition an irb was submitted to baker university the form is located in appendix c the baker irb approval letter is located in appendix d washburn university had two types of data collection systems in place during the period identified for the study spring through spring the as data collection system generated paper reports for and the researcher was allowed access to paper records for and enrollment results for all technology administration sections for were entered manually into an excel spreadsheet in the university transferred to the banner electronic student data management system all records since were archived electronically and were retrieved utilizing the following filters for data specific to students enrolled in the identified technology administration courses ta course designation and specific coding for year and semester to be analyzed spring semester fall semester x for specified year results retrieved under the banner system were saved as an excel spreadsheet by the researcher the course enrollment data for the sample are presented in tables e and e student transcripts and records were analyzed to determine program completion or continued enrollment in the program for program retention analysis documents examined included paper student advising files located within the technology administration department and specific student records housed within the banner reporting system technology administration course ta was selected based on the following a it is a required entry course only for technology administration majors and b ta is a dual enrollment course for business department majors data analysis data analysis for all hypothesis testing was conducted utilizing spss software version the software system provided automated analysis of the statistical measures to address research question a twofactor analysis of variance was used to analyze for a potential difference in delivery method online and facetoface potential difference in instructor instructors a and b and potential interaction between the two factors when the analysis of variance reveals a difference between the levels of any factor salkind referred to this as the main effect this analysis produces three f statistics to determine if a difference in grades of online students as compared to their classroom based counterparts was affected by a main effect for delivery a main effect for instructor and for interaction between instructor and delivery chisquare testing was selected to address research questions and the rationale for selecting chisquare testing was to observe whether a specific distribution of frequencies is the same as if it were to occur by chance salkind if the obtained chisquare value is greater than the critical value it indicates there is sufficient evidence to believe the research hypothesis is true for research question a chisquare test for differences between proportions analyzed course retention of online and facetoface students at the end of semester for research question a chisquare test for differences between proportions analyzed program retention comparing students who began the program in the online section of ta to the students who began in the facetoface section limitations of the study roberts defined the limitations of the study as those features of the study that may affect the results of the study or the ability to generalize the results the limitations of this study included a potential for data entry error b curriculum modifications not reflected in the syllabi made by instructors over the period of the study c behavior of the instructors during delivery in the two different formats and d rationale of students for selecting one course delivery method over another these may affect the generalizability of this study to other populations summary this chapter described the research design population and sample hypotheses data collection and analysis used in this research study statistical analysis using two way analysis of variance and chisquare were used to determine if there are significant statistical differences in the course grades course retention and program retention of students enrolled in online classes as compared to their faceto face counterparts the results of this study are presented in chapter four chapter four results the study had three main purposes the first purpose was to determine if there was a difference in grades between students in online classes and students in traditional facetoface classes in the technology administration program in addition the study was designed to examine the difference in course retention rates of students in the online classes as compared to the facetoface classes the third part of the study was designed to examine program retention rates of students who began the program in online classes and students who began the program in traditional facetoface classes this chapter begins with the descriptive statistics for the sample gender age grades by gender and course selection of students in online or facetoface courses by gender from the three research questions research hypotheses were developed and the results of statistical analyses used to test each hypothesis are presented descriptive statistics demographic data for the sample was collected from the student data system for through the descriptive statistics presented below include gender n age n grades by

summary in this chapter an introduction provided a summary of the analysis and statistical testing and in the order in which it was presented this was followed by descriptive statistics of the sample including age range of participants grades by gender and course selection by gender results from testing of h revealed no significant difference between course grades of online students and students enrolled in traditional facetoface classes chi square testing was utilized for testing of h results indicated there was no significant difference in course retention of students enrolled in online courses and students enrolled in traditional facetoface courses h was also tested utilizing chisquare testing the results indicated no significant difference in program retention of students who began the ta program in online courses and students who began in traditional facetoface courses chapter five provides a summary of the study discussion of the findings in relationship to the literature implications for practice recommendations for further research and conclusions chapter five interpretation and recommendations introduction in the preceding chapter the results of the analysis were reported chapter five consists of the summary of the study an overview of the problem purpose statement and research questions review of the methodology major findings and findings related to the literature chapter five also contains implications for further action and recommendations for further research the purpose of the latter sections is to expand on the research into distance education including implications for expansion of course and program delivery and future research finally a summary is offered to capture the scope and substance of what has been offered in the research study summary the online delivery of course content in higher education has increased dramatically in the past decade allen and seaman a reported that almost million students participated in at least one online course during the fall term a nearly increase over the number reported in the previous year they also reported a increase in online enrollment compared to the growth in overall higher education as online delivery has grown so has criticism of its efficacy online delivery of education has become an important strategy for the institution that is the setting of this study the purpose of this study was threefold the first purpose of the study was to determine if there was a significant difference between the course grades of students participating in ta online courses and their traditional classroom based counterparts the second purpose of the study was to determine if there was a significant difference between course retention of students participating in ta online courses and their traditional classroombased counterparts a third purpose of the study was to determine if there was a significant difference between program retention of students who began the ta program in online courses and those who began the program enrolled in traditional facetoface courses the study was designed to expand the knowledge base concerning online education and its efficacy in providing baccalaureate degree completion opportunities the research design was a quantitative study to compare course grades course retention and program retention of students enrolled in the online and traditional faceto face ta program at washburn university archival data from the student system at washburn university was utilized to compare online and traditional facetoface students in order to answer research question a sample of students enrolled in ta and ta online and traditional facetoface courses was analyzed the sample included students entering the program in the fall semesters of and two instructors were responsible for concurrent instruction of both the online and face toface classes for the period analyzed a twofactor analysis of variance was used to analyze for a potential difference in the dependent variable course grades due to delivery method online and facetoface the instructor instructors a and b and the potential interaction between the two independent variables research question a chisquare test for differences among proportions was used to analyze both course and program retention research questions and for research question archived data from the washburn university student system was analyzed for students enrolled in ta and ta additional variables identified for this sample included course selection and instructor a or b for research question archived data from the washburn university system was used which identified students with declared technology administration majors who began the ta program enrolled in online and facetoface courses a single gatekeeper course ta was identified for testing two instructors a and b were responsible for instruction during the testing period a twofactor anova was utilized to test h there is a statistically significant difference in course grades of students participating in online courses and students enrolled in a traditional classroom setting at the level of significance anova testing was utilized to account for the two delivery methods and two instructors involved for the period of the study the results of the test indicated there was no statistically significant difference in grades due to delivery method the results of the testing also indicated no statistically significant difference in grades due to instructor and no interaction between the two independent variables the research hypothesis was not supported to test the next hypothesis chisquare testing was utilized h there is a statistically significant difference in student course retention between students participating in online courses and students enrolled in facetoface courses at the level of significance the result of the chisquare testing indicated there was no statistically significant difference in course retention of students enrolled in online courses and students enrolled in facetoface courses in the ta program the research hypothesis was not supported to test the final hypothesis chisquare testing was also used h there is a statistically significant difference in program retention between students who begin the technology administration program in online courses and students who begin in faceto face courses at the level of significance the result of the chisquare testing indicated there was no statistically significant difference in the program retention rate of students who began the ta program in the online courses and students who began the program in the facetoface courses the research hypothesis was not supported testing found that course retention was high in both formats leading to interpretation that higher results may be due to the age of participants or prior degree completion the results found no significant difference in grades course or program retention for students in online ta courses and students enrolled in traditional facetoface instruction the implication of these results compared to current literature is discussed in the next section findings related to the literature online education has become a strategy for higher education to provide instruction to students limited by distance or time or who for other reasons do not wish to attend traditional classroombased university classes additionally online education allows higher education institutions to expand their geographic base institutions have utilized distance education for over a century to provide instruction but it was only within the last two decades that instruction over the internet had replaced correspondence television and video courses as the method of choice for delivery russell utilizing grades as a measure of achievement metaanalyses conducted by russell shachar and neumann and machtmes and asher found no significant difference in grades of online students and traditional classroombased students these analyses utilized multiple studies of course information comparing grades of online students and traditional facetoface students primarily utilizing t tests as the preferred methodology the results of previous research were supported by the present study additionally this study went further analyzing data over more than one semester controlling for the effect of different instructors these results were contrary to the conclusion reached by phipps and merisotis the second purpose of the study was to determine if a significant difference existed between the course retention of students enrolled in online ta courses and students enrolled in facetoface courses metaanalyses conducted by phipps and merisotis and nora and snyder concluded a much lower course retention rate in online students as compared to their facetoface counterparts the previous meta analyses examined retention of online students and traditional facetoface students in distinct courses utilizing t tests as the primary methodology the chosen method of t tests was used instead of the chi square testing due to the limitations of the studies to one course taught by one instructor limited to one semester or cycle carr reported in the chronicle of higher education that retention of online students was less than that of traditional facetoface students carrs results were based on the examination of longitudinal retention data from universities as reported to the united states department of education the results of the present study found no significant difference in the course retention rates these results are supported by the findings of carmel and gold in which they reported no significant difference in course retention rates of online students compared to traditional facetoface students in their analysis of students in multiple courses in disciplines across a year university the present study expanded those results examining course data in the same discipline over a year period and controlling for delivery by two separate instructors research into program completion rates of aas students has been conducted primarily in traditional university settings including townsends studies at the university of missouricolumbia townsends results showed a lower baccalaureate completion rate for students entering with an aas than students who transferred to year universities with an aa degree studies by hogan of vocationaleducation programs also found a lower program completion rate for online students compared to students in traditional delivery vocational education programs analysis of the data in the current study showed no significant difference in program completion rate of students who began in online ta courses as compared to students who began the program in face toface courses conclusions the use of distance education for postsecondary instruction primarily in the form of the internet has both changed and challenged the views of traditional universitybased instruction multiple studies have been designed in an effort to examine whether online students have the same level of academic achievement as their traditional higher education peers the present study agrees with the research indicating there is no statistically significant difference in the grades of online students and their facetoface counterparts in addition with student retention an issue for all postsecondary institutions the data from previous studies indicated a lower retention rate for online students than for their traditional facetoface classmates the current study contradicted those arguments in the following sections implications for action recommendations for research and concluding remarks are addressed implications for action as postsecondary institutions move into the st century many have examined issues of student recruitment and retention in an effort to meet the demands of both their students and their communities the majority of postsecondary institutions have initiated online education as a strategy to recruit students from beyond their traditional geographic areas this study supported existing research utilizing grades as a measure of achievement and should alleviate doubt that online students are shortchanged in their education the transition of existing facetoface to courses to an online delivery model can be accomplished without sacrificing achievement of course and program goals the study also examined course and program retention data finding no significant differences between online and traditional students in the ta program the findings of this study support the expansion of additional online courses and programs within the school of applied studies finally this study can provide the basis for further action including analyzing other programs and courses offered in the online format by the university the analysis of other programs offered in an online delivery model would enhance further development of online courses and programs recommendations for future research distance education delivery has expanded dramatically with the use of the internet for online instruction the present study could be continued in future years to measure the effects of specific curriculum delivery models and changes made to online delivery platforms in addition the study could be expanded to include specific characteristics of student retention named in the literature such as examining whether the age and entering gpa of students provides any insight into course and program retention the study could also be expanded to include other universities with similar baccalaureatedegree completion programs and other disciplines because the body of research is limited concerning the baccalaureatedegree completion of students who begin their postsecondary education in careeroriented instruction there is value in continuing to study baccalaureate completion rates both in an online format and in more traditionally based settings concluding remarks the current study examined a technology administration program that has been offered in both online and facetoface format utilizing data from fall through spring the ta program was developed to allow students who had completed an occupationally oriented aas degree to complete a bachelors degree program three hypotheses were tested in this study examining course grades course retention and program retention of students enrolled in online and facetoface courses in technology administration no significant difference was found for the three hypotheses these results form a strong foundation for expanding online courses and programs at washburn university by addressing two of the major concerns of educators achievement and retention the study results allow expansion of online courses and programs to benefit from datadriven decisionmaking other institutions can and should utilize data to examine existing online course

relat to the literatur onlin educ ha becom a strategi for higher educ to provid instruct to student limit by distanc or time or who for other reason do not wish to attend tradit classroombas univers class addit onlin educ allow higher educ institut to expand their geograph base institut have util distanc educ for over a centuri to provid instruct but it wa onli within the last two decad that instruct over the internet had replac correspond televis and video cours as the method of choic for deliveri russel util grade as a measur of achiev metaanalys conduct by russel shachar and neumann

control for the effect of differ instructor these result were contrari to the conclus reach by phipp and merisoti the second purpos of the studi wa to determin if a signific differ exist between the cours retent of student enrol in onlin ta cours and student enrol in facetofac cours metaanalys conduct by phipp and merisoti and nora and snyder conclud a much lower cours retent rate in onlin student as compar to their facetofac counterpart the previou meta analys examin retent of onlin student and tradit facetofac student in distinct cours util t test as the primari methodolog the chosen method of t test wa use instead of the chi squar test due to the limit of the studi to one cours taught by one instructor limit to one semest or cycl carr report in the chronicl of higher educ that retent of onlin student wa less than that of tradit facetofac student carr result were base on the examin of longitudin retent data from univers as report to the unit state depart of educ the result of the present studi found no signific differ in the cours retent rate these result are support by the find of carmel and gold in which they report no signific differ in cours retent rate of onlin student compar to tradit facetofac student in their analysi of student in multipl cours in disciplin across a year univers the present studi expand those result examin cours data in the same disciplin over a year period and control for deliveri by two separ instructor research into program complet rate of aa student ha been conduct primarili in tradit univers set includ townsend studi at the univers of missouricolumbia townsend result show a lower baccalaur complet rate for student enter with an aa than student who transfer to year univers with an aa degre studi by hogan of vocationaleduc program also found a lower program complet rate for onlin student compar to student in tradit deliveri vocat educ program analysi of the data in the current studi show no signific differ in program complet rate of student who began in onlin ta cours as compar to student who began the program in face tofac cours conclus the use of distanc educ for postsecondari instruct primarili in the form of the internet ha both chang and challeng the view of tradit universitybas instruct multipl studi have been design in an effort to examin whether onlin student have the same level of academ achiev as their tradit higher educ peer the present studi agre with the research indic there is no statist signific differ in the grade of onlin student and their facetofac counterpart in addit with student retent an issu for all postsecondari institut the data from previou studi indic a lower retent rate for onlin student than for their tradit facetofac classmat the current studi contradict those argument in the follow section implic for action recommend for research and conclud remark are address implic for action as postsecondari institut move into the st centuri mani have examin issu of student recruit and retent in an effort to meet the demand of both their student and their commun the major of postsecondari institut have initi onlin educ as a strategi to recruit student from beyond their tradit geograph area thi studi support exist research util grade as a measur of achiev and should allevi doubt that onlin student are shortchang in their educ the transit of exist facetofac to cours to an onlin deliveri model can be accomplish without sacrif achiev of cours and program goal the studi also examin cours and program retent data find no signific differ between onlin and tradit student in the ta program the find of thi studi support the expans of addit onlin cours and program within the school of appli studi final thi studi can provid the basi for further action includ analyz other program and cours offer in the onlin format by the univers the analysi of other program offer in an onlin deliveri model would enhanc further develop of onlin cours and program recommend for futur research distanc educ deliveri ha expand dramat with the use of the internet for onlin instruct the present studi could be continu in futur year to measur the effect of specif curriculum deliveri model and chang made to onlin deliveri platform in addit the studi could be expand to includ specif characterist of student retent name in the literatur such as examin whether the age and enter gpa of student provid ani insight into cours and program retent the studi could also be expand to includ other univers with similar baccalaureatedegre complet program and other disciplin becaus the bodi of research is limit concern the baccalaureatedegre complet of student who begin their postsecondari educ in careerori instruct there is valu in continu to studi baccalaur complet rate both in an onlin format and in more tradit base set conclud remark the current studi examin a technolog administr program that ha been offer in both onlin and facetofac format util data from fall through spring the ta program wa develop to allow student who had complet an occup orient aa degre to complet a bachelor degre program three hypothes were test in thi studi examin cours grade cours retent and program retent of student enrol in onlin and facetofac cours in technolog administr no signific differ wa found for the three hypothes these result form a strong foundat for expand onlin cours and

this study \\n was undertaken in a midwestern university technology administration program a \\n bachelors degree completion program for students with an existing occupationally \\n oriented associate degree eighthundred eightyfive students were identified for the \\n sample a twofactor anova was used to answer the first research question is there is a \\n statistically significant difference between students grades in online classes and \\n traditional facetoface classes results showed no significant difference between the \\n grades of online and facetoface students chisquare analysis was used for research \\n question   is there a statistically significant difference between course retention in \\n online classes and traditional facetoface classes no significant difference was found \\n between course retention in online classes and facetoface classes last research \\n question   was answered utilizing chisquare analysis research question   was is there \\n a statistically significant difference between program retention for students entering the \\n program enrolled in online classes and students entering the program enrolled in \\n traditional facetoface classes the data showed no significant difference in course \\n retention of students who began the program in online courses and students who began in \\n facetoface courses implications for further action include recommendations for \\n expansion of online courses and programs supported by the research data analysis of \\n existing data of other online courses and programs is recommended recommendations \\n for further research included analyzing different delivery variations and continued study \\n  \\n iv \\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n of bachelors degree completion programs additional

historically postsecondary education in the united states was founded on the \\n principles of the european system requiring the physical presence of professors and \\n students in the same location knowles   from   with the founding of harvard \\n university the harvard guide   to the development of junior colleges and \\n vocational schools in the early s cohen   brawer   jacobs   grubb  \\n the higher education system developed to prepare posthigh school students for one of \\n three separate tiers the college and university system in the united states developed its \\n own set of structures designed to prepare students for baccalaureate and graduate degrees \\n junior colleges were limited to associate degrees while vocational education institutions \\n offered occupational certificates in many cases there was inadequate recognition of the \\n postsecondary education offered at junior colleges and vocational education institutions \\n resulting in the inability of students to transfer to year institutions national center for \\n education statistics   \\n in the midth century some junior colleges began to provide academic \\n vocational and personal development educational offerings for members of the local \\n communities during this same period junior or community colleges developed a role as \\n transfer institutions for students who because of time preparedness economics or \\n distance could not begin their postsecondary education at a year institution cohen  \\n brawer   until the mids the majority of transfer programs involved associate \\n of arts aa and associate of science as degrees associate of applied science \\n aas degrees were developed during the s the aas degree was granted to those \\n  \\n\\u00a0\\n who successfully completed the majority of their college program in vocational \\n education the creation of a variety of applied baccalaureate degrees allowed students \\n who had previously thought of the aas degree as a terminal program to complete a \\n baccalaureate degree kansas board of regents   \\n online education also became a strategy for students to access higher education in \\n the s allen   seaman b the proliferation of online courses alleviated some \\n of the locationbound barriers to higher education but online education was criticized as \\n less rigorous than traditional classroombased course work by traditional academicians \\n russell attempted to address this argument with his   metaanalysis of studies dating \\n from the s and covering multiple delivery models including online education \\n russell concluded there was no statistically significant difference in student achievement \\n between courses offered online and those offered in the traditional classroom setting \\n since the development of correspondence courses in the s researchers have \\n attempted to ascertain if students participating in distance education are being \\n shortchanged in their educational goals no significant difference in grades has been \\n found in the majority of studies designed to address this issue studies analyzing online \\n student retention have shown significantly lower retention for online students   in the last \\n  years research studies have expanded to include variations of online education these \\n include strictly online hybrid courses webassisted classroom settings and the \\n traditional higher education course offered only as facetoface instruction carmel  \\n gold   \\n online education continues to proliferate at the same time the number of \\n secondary students in the united states overall is projected to increase national center \\n  \\n\\u00a0\\n for education statistics nces   the projected increase of potential postsecondary \\n students and online postsecondary options provides opportunities for increases in online \\n education programs and courses in   nces reported that over   of students in \\n higher education were participating in online courses in a   study allen and seaman \\n estimated only   of those enrolled in online education courses are undergraduate \\n students seeking their first degree counter to the projected increase in traditionalage \\n students the majority of enrollees in online education are adults updating or advancing \\n their credentials creating an additional educational market for colleges and universities \\n seeking to expand enrollment without adding physical space allen   seaman a \\n for states and localities faced with a contradictory traditionalage enrollment decrease \\n these figures present an untapped market for higher education courses and programs \\n background \\n researchers attempted to analyze the efficacy of distance education as far back as \\n the s when correspondence courses were created to meet the need of students not \\n willing to attend a traditional classroombased higher education setting a metaanalysis \\n of these studies resulted in the no significant difference phenomenon reported by \\n russell   the results of over   studies were compiled comparing various modes \\n of delivery including correspondence audio television courses and the newest wave of \\n computerfacilitated instruction following analyses of studies completed prior to  \\n russell concluded there was no difference in learning between students enrolled in \\n distance education and those completing courses in the traditional setting  \\n studies completed since then have provided mixed results summers waigand \\n and whittaker   found there was no difference in gpa and retention between the \\n  \\n\\u00a0\\n online and traditional classroom arle   found higher achievement by online \\n students and brown and liedholm   found gpa and student retention better in a \\n traditional classroom setting  \\n \\n student retention is an integral part of the student achievement conversation and \\n is an issue for all forms of higher education degreeseeking students overall retention \\n has been reported as less than   by nces   long considered a problem in \\n higher education attention to the distance education model has shown even lower \\n retention rates in online students than in students attending at the traditional college \\n setting phipps   meristosis   research on different modalities such as fully \\n online and hybrid online courses has produced mixed results carmel   gold   no \\n significant trend toward increased retention of students in any of the online modalities \\n has been documented  \\n retention studies of transfer students have primarily included traditionally defined \\n students transfering from a community college statistics have consistantly shown a \\n lower retention rate for students transfering from a community college to a year \\n university than for students who began their posthigh school education at a year \\n institution nces   townsends studies of transfer students at the university of \\n missouricolumbia also showed a lower baccalaureate retention rate for students who \\n had completed an aas degree than for students beginning their education at a year \\n institution townsend  \\n occupationally oriented bachelors degree completion programs are relatively \\n new to higher education transfer programs in the liberal arts from community colleges \\n to year institutions were common by the s townsend   in her study \\n  \\n\\u00a0\\n conducted at the university of missouricolumbia observed the blurring of the lines \\n between nontransferrable occupationally oriented undergraduate degrees and \\n undergraduate degrees and certificates that were easily transferred the study conducted \\n by townsend was among the first to recognize that many students who began their \\n education at community and technical colleges had bachelors degree aspirations that \\n grew after their completion of an occupationallyoriented degree laanan proposed that \\n the increase in institutions offering aas degrees necessitated new ways to transfer \\n undergraduate credits   \\n the setting of this study is a mediumsized midwestern campus located in \\n topeka kansas washburn university enrolls approximately   students a year in \\n undergraduate and graduate programs including liberal arts professional schools and a \\n law school washburn university   the technology administration ta program \\n selected for the present study began in the s as a baccalaureate degree completion \\n program for students who had received an occupationally oriented associate degree at a \\n kansas community college or through washburns articulation agreement with kansas \\n vocationaltechnical schools this program provided students who previously had \\n obtained an associate of applied science degree in an occupational area an opportunity \\n to earn a bachelors degree \\n peterson dean of continuing education washburn university stated that in \\n early   washburn university began online courses and programs at the behest of a \\n neighboring community college personal communication april    washburn \\n was asked to develop an online bachelors degree completion program for students \\n graduating from community colleges and technical colleges with an associate of applied \\n  \\n\\u00a0\\n science degree the ta program was among the first programs to offer the online \\n bachelors degree completion option the ta program offered its first online courses in \\n spring   \\n online education at washburn expanded to other programs and courses to \\n include over   courses washburn university   the original online partnership \\n with two community colleges expanded to include   additional community colleges and \\n four technical colleges in kansas as well as colleges in missouri california wisconsin \\n south carolina and nebraska washburn university  \\n an initial study in   of students course grades and retention in online courses \\n offered at washburn showed no significant difference between students enrolled in online \\n courses and students enrolled in traditional facetoface course work peterson   personal \\n communication april    no studies of program retention have been completed  \\n in   atkins reported overall enrollment at washburn university decreased \\n  from fall   to fall   from   to   students during the same period \\n online course enrollment patterns increased   from   students to   in \\n  washburn university   atkins also reported that between   and   the \\n ratio of traditional posthigh school age students to nontraditional students enrolling at \\n washburn university reversed from   to   the shift in enrollment patterns \\n produced an increase in enrollment in the early part of the st century however \\n washburn university anticipated a decrease in high school graduates in kansas through \\n  based on demographic patterns of the state the state figures are opposite the \\n anticipated increase of traditionalage students nationally nces   the increase in \\n  \\n\\u00a0\\n distance education students in relation to the anticipated decline in traditionalage \\n students provided the focus for the study \\n \\n purpose of the study \\n online education has become an important strategy for the higher education \\n institution that was the setting of this study first the purpose of the study was to \\n determine if there was a significant difference between the course grades of students \\n participating in ta online courses and their traditional classroombased counterparts the \\n second purpose of the study was to determine if there was a significant difference \\n between course retention of students participating in ta online courses and their \\n traditional classroombased counterparts the second part of the study was a replication \\n of studies comparing modes of online course delivery to traditional classroombased \\n instruction carmel   gold   russell   a third purpose of the study was to \\n determine if there was a significant difference between program retention of students who \\n began the ta program in online courses and those who began the program enrolled in \\n traditional facetoface courses the studys purpose was to expand the knowledge base \\n concerning online education to include its efficacy in providing baccalaureate degree \\n completion opportunities \\n research questions \\n roberts   stated research questions guide the study and usually provide the \\n structure for presenting the results of the research the research questions guiding this \\n study were \\n  \\n\\u00a0\\n \\n is there is a statistically significant difference between students grades in \\n online classes and traditional facetoface classes \\n \\n is there a statistically significant difference between course retention rates \\n in online classes and traditional facetoface classes  \\n \\n is there a statistically significant difference between program retention for \\n students entering the program enrolled in online classes and students \\n entering the program enrolled in traditional facetoface classes \\n overview of the methodology \\n \\n a quantitative study was utilized to compare grades by course course retention \\n and program retention of students enrolled in the online and traditional facetoface ta \\n program at washburn university archival data from the student system at washburn \\n university were utilized from comparative online and traditional facetoface classes in \\n two separate courses in order to answer research question   a sample of   students \\n enrolled in online and traditional facetoface courses was identified the sample \\n included students entering the program in the fall semesters of     \\n and   in both the online and traditional facetoface classes two instructors were \\n responsible for concurrent instruction of both the online and facetoface classes for the \\n period analyzed a twofactor analysis of variance was used to analyze for the potential \\n difference in the dependent variables course grades due to delivery method online and \\n facetoface instructor instructors a and b and the potential interaction between the \\n two independent variables research question   a chisquare test for differences \\n among proportions was used to analyze course and program retention research \\n questions   and   \\n  \\n\\u00a0\\n delimitations \\n \\n roberts   defined delimitations as the boundaries of the study that are \\n controlled principally by the researcher the delimitations for this study were \\n \\n only data from   through   from technology administration \\n online and facetoface courses were utilized \\n \\n the study was confined to students enrolled at washburn university in the \\n technology administration program \\n \\n only grades and retention were analyzed \\n \\n assumptions \\n assumptions are defined as those things presupposed in a study roberts  \\n the study was based on the following assumptions \\n \\n delivery of content was consistent between online and facetoface \\n courses and instructors \\n \\n course objectives were the same for paired online and traditional faceto \\n face courses  \\n \\n all students enrolled in the ta program met the same criteria for \\n admission to the university  \\n \\n all data entered in the excel spreadsheets were correct \\n \\n all students enrolled in the ta program met the same criteria for grade \\n

literature review \\n this chapter presents the background for research into the efficacy of distance \\n education in the delivery of higher education research studies have focused primarily on \\n grades as a measure of the quality of distance education courses as compared to \\n traditional facetoface instruction utilizing grades has produced a dividing line among \\n education researchers concerning the use of distance education as a delivery model \\n retention in distance education has focused primarily on single courses with little \\n program retention data available data from retention studies in higher education have \\n focused primarily on the traditional year university student retention studies of \\n community college students have produced quantitative results however these studies \\n have been directed at community college students who identify themselves as transfer \\n students early in their community college careers retention studies of students enrolled \\n in occupationally oriented programs are limited \\n statistical data of higher education shows an increased use of distance education \\n for traditional academic courses as well as occupationally oriented courses the increase \\n in distance education courses and programs has provided a new dimension to studies of \\n both grades and retention the recognition of this increase as well as questions \\n concerning its impact on student learning and retention produced the impetus for this \\n study \\n the following review of the literature represents the literature related to this \\n research study through examination of previous research the direction of the present \\n study was formulated specifically the chapter is organized into four sections a the \\n  \\n\\u00a0\\n

focused on factors of student engagement how students respond to instructors the \\n higher education community itself and students own engagement in learning are the \\n primary factors tinto theorized as determining the students retention in the concluding \\n remarks to his   treatise on retention tinto acknowledged that persistence in higher \\n education is but one facet of human growth and development and one that can not \\n necessarily be attributed to a single factor or strategy \\n tintos   original study of student retention included the observation that \\n student retention is a complicated web of events that shape student leaving and \\n persistence he observed that the view of student retention had changed since the s \\n when students were thought to leave due to lack of motivation persistence and skills \\n hence the name dropout in the s research began to focus on the role of the \\n environment in student decisions to stay or leave in the s tinto proposed that the \\n actions of the faculty were the key to institutional efforts to enhance student retention \\n tinto   this was a significant addition to his theory placing the cause on the \\n instructor instead of the student and it has done much to influence retention strategies \\n  \\n\\u00a0\\n utilized in higher education institutions tinto   tintos studies have driven \\n research in

theorists and researchers have attempted to utilize tintos model of student persistence \\n to explain retention issues involved with distance education however rovai  \\n analyzed the differing

population were no longer applicable to distance \\n education learners rovai proposed that distance educators could address retention in \\n ways that traditional higher education has not he suggested that distance educators \\n utilize strategies such as capitalizing on students expectations of technology addressing \\n economic benefits and specific educational needs to increase student retention in courses \\n rovai  \\n the expanded use of technology created a distinct subset of research into student \\n retention issues in   berge and huang developed an overview of models of student \\n retention with special emphasis on models developed to explain the retention rates in \\n distance education their studies primarily focused on the variables in student \\n demographics and external factors such as age and gender which influence persistence \\n and retention in online learning berge and huang found that traditional models of \\n student retention such as tintos did not acknowledge the differences in student \\n expectations and goals that are ingrained in the students selection of the online learning \\n option \\n other researchers have attempted to study retention issues specifically for online \\n education in a metaanalysis nora and snyder   found the majority of studies of \\n online education focused on students individual characteristics and individual \\n  \\n\\u00a0\\n perceptions of technology nora and snyder concluded that researchers attempt to utilize \\n traditional models of student engagement to explain student retention issues in distance or \\n online learning courses with little or no success this supported berge and huards \\n conclusions nora and snyder   also noted a dearth of quantitative research  \\n few quantitative studies exist that support higher or equal retention in online \\n students compared to their classroombased counterparts one example is the carmel and \\n gold   study they found no significant difference in student retention rates \\n between students in distance education courses and their traditional classroombased \\n counterparts the study utilized data from   students   enrolled in classroombased \\n courses and   enrolled in a hybrid online format participants randomly selfselected and \\n were not all enrolled in the same course introducing variables not attributed in the study  \\n the majority of quantitative studies instead concluded there is a higher retention \\n rate in traditional classrooms than in distance education in the phipps and merisotis \\n  review of russells original research which included online education results \\n indicated that research has shown even lower retention rates in online students than in \\n students attending classes in the traditional college setting the high dropout rate among \\n distance education students was not addressed in russells metaanalysis and phipps and \\n merisotis found no suitable explanation in the research they postulated that the \\n decreased retention rate documented within distance education studies skews \\n achievement data by excluding the dropouts \\n diaz   found a high drop rate for online students compared to traditional \\n classroombased students in an online health education course at nova southeastern \\n other studies have supported the theory that retention of online students is far below that \\n  \\n\\u00a0\\n of the traditional campus students in   carr reporting for the chronicle of higher \\n education noted that online courses routinely lose    of students

difficultly faced in retaining distance education students who do not routinely meet with \\n faculty the data have not been refuted \\n as community colleges began utilizing distance education retention rates were \\n reported as higher than traditional students nash   however the california \\n community college system report for fall   courses showed inconsistent retention \\n results for

lower retention rates were indicated in online engineering social \\n sciences and mathematics courses as compared to traditional classroom instructional \\n models california community colleges

technical course and program completion of students in distance and traditional \\n vocational education and found that course completion rates were higher for distance \\n education students however program completion rates were higher for traditional \\n students than for students enrolled in distance education hogan   \\n in summary studies of retention have focused primarily on student characteristics \\n while acknowledging that postsecondary retention rates vary according to a variety of \\n factors research showed mixed results concerning the retention rate of online students \\n  \\n\\u00a0\\n though quantitative data leans heavily toward a lower course retention rate in online \\n students data from year universities have shown lower retention rates for online \\n students

chapter five \\n consists of the summary of the study an overview of the problem purpose statement and \\n research questions review of the methodology major findings and findings related to the \\n literature chapter five also contains implications for further action and \\n recommendations for further research the purpose of the latter sections is to expand on \\n the research into distance education including implications for expansion of course and \\n program delivery and future research finally a summary is offered to capture the scope \\n and substance of what has been offered in the research \\n study summary \\n the online delivery of course content in higher education has increased \\n dramatically in the past decade allen and seaman a reported that almost  \\n million students participated in at least one online course during the fall   term a \\n nearly   increase over the number reported in the previous year they also reported a \\n  increase in online enrollment compared to the   growth in overall higher \\n education as online delivery has grown so has criticism of its efficacy \\n online delivery of education has become an important strategy for the institution \\n that is the setting of this study the purpose of this study was threefold the first purpose \\n of the study was to determine if there was a significant difference between the course \\n grades of students participating in ta online courses and their traditional classroom \\n based counterparts the second purpose of the study was to determine if there was a \\n  \\n\\u00a0\\n significant difference between course retention of students participating in ta online \\n courses and their traditional classroombased counterparts a third purpose of the study \\n was to determine if there was a significant difference between program retention of \\n students who began the ta program in online courses and those who began the program \\n enrolled in traditional facetoface courses the study was designed to expand the \\n knowledge base concerning online education and its efficacy in providing baccalaureate \\n degree completion opportunities \\n the research design was a quantitative study to compare course grades course \\n retention and program retention of students enrolled in the online and traditional faceto \\n face ta program at washburn university archival data from the student system at \\n washburn university was utilized to compare online and traditional facetoface students \\n in order to answer research question   a sample of students enrolled in ta   and ta \\n  online and traditional facetoface courses was analyzed the sample included \\n students entering the program in the fall semesters of      and  \\n two instructors were responsible for concurrent instruction of both the online and face \\n toface classes for the period analyzed a twofactor analysis of variance was used to \\n analyze for a potential difference in the dependent variable course grades due to \\n delivery method online and facetoface the instructor instructors a and b and the \\n potential interaction between the two independent variables research question   \\n a chisquare test for differences among proportions was used to analyze both \\n course and program retention research questions   and   for research question  \\n archived data from the washburn university student system was analyzed for students \\n enrolled in ta   and ta   additional variables identified for this sample included \\n  \\n\\u00a0\\n course selection and instructor a or b for research question   archived data from the \\n washburn university system was used which identified students with declared \\n technology administration majors who began the ta program enrolled in online and \\n facetoface courses a single gatekeeper course ta   was identified for testing two \\n instructors a and b were responsible for instruction during the testing period  \\n \\n a twofactor anova was utilized to test h there is a statistically significant \\n difference in course grades of students participating in online courses and students \\n enrolled in a traditional classroom setting at the   level of significance anova \\n testing was utilized to account for the two delivery methods and two instructors involved \\n for the period of the study the results of the test indicated there was no statistically \\n significant difference in grades due to delivery method the results of the testing also \\n indicated no statistically significant difference in grades due to instructor and no \\n interaction between the two independent variables the research hypothesis was not \\n supported \\n \\n to test the next hypothesis chisquare testing was utilized h there is a \\n statistically significant difference in student course retention between students \\n participating in online courses and students enrolled in facetoface courses at the  \\n level of significance   the result of the chisquare testing indicated there was no \\n statistically significant difference in course retention of students enrolled in online \\n courses and students enrolled in facetoface courses in the ta program the research \\n hypothesis was not supported \\n \\n to test the final hypothesis chisquare testing was also used h there is a \\n statistically significant difference in program retention between students who begin the \\n  \\n\\u00a0\\n technology administration program in online courses and students who begin in faceto \\n face courses at the   level of significance the result of the chisquare testing \\n indicated there was no statistically significant difference in the program retention rate of \\n students who began the ta program in the online courses and students who began the \\n program in the facetoface courses the research hypothesis was not supported testing \\n found that course retention was high in both formats leading to interpretation that higher \\n results may be due to the age of participants or prior degree completion \\n the results found no significant difference in grades course or program retention \\n for students in online ta courses and students enrolled in traditional facetoface \\n instruction the implication of these results compared to current literature is discussed in \\n the next section \\n findings related to the literature \\n \\n online education has become a strategy for higher education to provide \\n instruction to students limited by distance or time or who for other reasons do not wish \\n to attend traditional classroombased university classes additionally online education \\n allows higher education institutions to expand their geographic base institutions have \\n utilized distance education for over a century to provide instruction but it was only \\n within the last two decades that instruction over the internet had replaced \\n correspondence television and video courses as the method of choice for delivery \\n russell  \\n \\n utilizing grades as a measure of achievement metaanalyses conducted by \\n russell   shachar and neumann   and machtmes and asher   found no \\n significant difference in grades of online students and traditional classroombased \\n  \\n\\u00a0\\n students these analyses utilized multiple studies of course information comparing \\n grades of online students and traditional facetoface students primarily utilizing t tests \\n as the preferred methodology the results of previous research were supported by the \\n present study additionally this study went further analyzing data over more than one \\n semester controlling for the effect of different instructors these results were contrary to \\n the conclusion reached by phipps and merisotis  \\n \\n the second purpose of the study was to determine if a significant difference \\n existed between the course retention of students enrolled in online ta courses and \\n students enrolled in facetoface courses metaanalyses conducted by phipps and \\n merisotis   and nora and snyder   concluded a much lower course retention \\n rate in online students as compared to their facetoface counterparts the previous meta \\n analyses examined retention of online students and traditional facetoface students in \\n distinct courses utilizing t tests as the primary methodology the chosen method of t \\n tests was used instead of the chi square testing due to the limitations of the studies to one \\n course taught by one instructor limited to one semester or cycle carr   reported in \\n the chronicle of higher education that retention of online students was   less than \\n that of traditional facetoface students carrs results were based on the examination of \\n longitudinal retention data from universities as reported to the united states department \\n of education  \\n the results of the present study found no significant difference in the course \\n retention rates these results are supported by the findings of carmel and gold   in \\n which they reported no significant difference in course retention rates of online students \\n compared to traditional facetoface students in their analysis of students in multiple \\n  \\n\\u00a0\\n courses in disciplines across a year university the present study expanded those \\n results examining course data in the same discipline over a year period and controlling \\n for delivery by two separate instructors  \\n \\n research into program completion rates of aas students has been conducted \\n primarily in traditional university settings including townsends   studies at the \\n university of missouricolumbia townsends results showed a lower baccalaureate \\n completion rate for students entering with an aas than students who transferred to \\n year universities with an aa degree studies by hogan   of vocationaleducation \\n programs also found a lower program completion rate for online students compared to \\n students in traditional delivery vocational education programs analysis of the data in the \\n current study showed no significant difference in program completion rate of students \\n who began in online ta courses as compared to students who began the program in face \\n toface courses  \\n conclusions \\n \\n the use of distance education for postsecondary instruction primarily in the form \\n of the internet has both changed and challenged the views of traditional universitybased \\n instruction multiple studies have been designed in an effort to examine whether online \\n students have the same level of academic achievement as their traditional higher \\n education peers the present study agrees with the research indicating there is no \\n statistically significant difference in the grades of online students and their facetoface \\n counterparts in addition with student retention an issue for all postsecondary \\n institutions the data from previous studies indicated a lower retention rate for online \\n students than for their traditional facetoface classmates the current study contradicted \\n  \\n\\u00a0\\n those arguments in the following sections implications for action recommendations for \\n research and concluding remarks are addressed \\n implications for action \\n \\n as postsecondary institutions move into the st century many have examined \\n issues of student recruitment and retention in an effort to meet the demands of both their \\n students and their communities the majority of postsecondary institutions have initiated \\n online education as a strategy to recruit students from beyond their traditional geographic \\n areas this study supported existing research utilizing grades as a measure of \\n achievement and should alleviate doubt that online students are shortchanged in their \\n education the transition of existing facetoface to courses to an online delivery model \\n can be accomplished without sacrificing achievement of course and program goals \\n \\n the study also examined course and program retention data finding no significant \\n differences between online and traditional students in the ta program the findings of \\n this study support the expansion of additional online courses and programs within the \\n school of applied studies  \\n finally this study can provide the basis for further action including analyzing \\n other programs and courses offered in the online format by the university the analysis \\n of other programs offered in an online delivery model would enhance further \\n development of online courses and programs \\n recommendations for future research \\n distance education delivery has expanded dramatically with the use of the \\n internet for online instruction the present study could be continued in future years to \\n measure the effects of specific curriculum delivery models and changes made to online \\n  \\n\\u00a0\\n delivery platforms in addition the study could be expanded to include specific \\n characteristics of student retention named in the literature such as examining whether the \\n age and entering gpa of students provides any insight into course and program retention \\n the study could also be expanded to include other universities with similar \\n baccalaureatedegree completion programs and other disciplines because the body of \\n research is limited concerning the baccalaureatedegree completion of students who begin \\n their postsecondary education in careeroriented instruction there is value in continuing \\n to study baccalaureate completion rates both in an online format and in more \\n traditionally based settings \\n concluding remarks \\n the current study examined a technology administration program that has been \\n offered in both online and facetoface format utilizing data from fall   through \\n spring   the ta program was developed to allow students who had completed an \\n occupationally oriented aas degree to complete a bachelors degree program three \\n hypotheses were tested in this study examining course grades course retention and \\n program retention of students enrolled in online and facetoface courses in technology \\n administration no significant difference was found for the three hypotheses  \\n these results form a strong foundation for expanding online courses and \\n programs at washburn university by addressing two of the major concerns of educators \\n achievement and retention the study results allow expansion of online courses and \\n programs to benefit from datadriven decisionmaking other institutions can and should \\n utilize data to examine existing online course and program data  \\n  \\n\\u00a0\\n references \\n allen i e   seaman j   seizing

to explain student retention issue at university and college tinto model primarily \\n focus on factor of student engagement how student respond to instructor the \\n high education community itself and student own engagement in learn be the \\n primary factor tinto theorize as determine the student retention in the concluding \\n remark to his   treatise on retention tinto acknowledge that persistence in high \\n education be but one facet of human growth and development and one that can not \\n necessarily be attribute to a single factor or strategy \\n tinto   original study of student retention include the observation that \\n student retention be a complicated web of event that shape student leave and \\n persistence he observe that the view of student retention have change since the s \\n when student be think to leave due to lack of motivation persistence and skill \\n hence the name dropout in the s research begin to focus on the role of the \\n environment in student decision to stay or leave in the s tinto propose that the \\n action of the faculty be the key to institutional effort to enhance student retention \\n tinto   this be a significant addition to his theory place the cause on the \\n instructor instead of the student and it have do much to influence retention strategy \\n  \\n\\u00a0\\n utilize in high education institution tinto   tinto study have drive \\n research in both traditional retention study and those involve distance education  \\n study of the persistence of the postsecondary student routinely focus on year \\n postsecondary education it be only within the last   year that persistence study have \\n include community college student and occupational student acknowledge that their \\n reason for enter the postsecondary community be different from the traditional \\n year high education participant cohen   brawer   with different avenue to a \\n baccalaureate degree more prevalent the research into

\\n nce   the report acknowledge institution be unable to follow student who \\n transfer to other institution they be able to report only the absence of enrollment in \\n their own institution  \\n research have also find a large gap between community college entrant and \\n year college entrant in rate of attain a bachelor degree dougherty   report \\n that student enter community college receive   to   few bachelor degree \\n than student begin at a year university dougherty postulate that the low \\n baccalaureate attainment rate of community college entrant be attributable to both their \\n individual trait and the institution they enter dougherty  \\n  \\n\\u00a0\\n study of student retention of community college also vary base on the type of \\n student community college retention rate be routinely report as low than \\n traditional year institution nce   cohen and brawer   attribute the \\n difference in retention to the difference in the mission in many instance student do \\n not enroll in a community college in order to attain a degree cohen   brawer  \\n the most recent longitudinal study in   show a retention rate of   of student \\n after   year nce   \\n of community college student only   indicate a desire to transfer later to a \\n baccalaureate degree completion program nce   while retention datum collect \\n by the federal government nce   do not include student with an aas degree \\n townsend study of the transfer rate and baccalaureate attainment rate of student in \\n missouri who have complete an associate of art and student who have complete an \\n associate of apply science degree be   compare to   townsend   \\n vocational or occupational program have report retention rate as program \\n completion a definition involve completion of specific task and competency \\n instead of grade and tie to a limited program length this state and federal requirement \\n indicate program quality and ensure continued federal funding in   the us \\n department of education report a   completion rate of postsecondary student \\n enrol in occupational education nce   until   the reason for student \\n leave be neither delineated nor

\\n\\u00a0\\n distance education provide a new arena for the study of student persistence \\n theorist and researcher have attempt to utilize tinto model of student persistence \\n to explain retention issue involve with distance education however rovai  \\n analyze the differ student characteristic of distance learner as compare to the \\n traditional student target by tinto original model and conclude that student \\n retention theory propose from that population be no long applicable to distance \\n education learner rovai propose that distance educator could address retention in \\n way that traditional high education have not he suggest that distance educator \\n utilize strategy such as capitalize on student expectation of technology address \\n economic benefit and specific educational need to increase student retention in course \\n rovai  \\n the expand use of technology create a distinct subset of research into student \\n retention issue in   berge and huang develop an overview of model of student \\n retention with special emphasis on model develop to explain the retention rate in \\n distance education their study primarily focus on the variable in student \\n demographic and external factor such as age and gender which influence persistence \\n and retention in online learn berge and huang find that traditional model of \\n student retention such as tinto do not acknowledge the difference in student \\n expectation and goal that be ingrain in the student selection of the online learning \\n option \\n other researcher have attempt to study retention issue specifically for online \\n education in a metaanalysis nora and snyder   find the majority of study of \\n online education focus on student individual characteristic and individual \\n  \\n\\u00a0\\n perception of technology nora and snyder conclude that researcher attempt to utilize \\n traditional model of student engagement to explain student retention issue in distance or \\n online learn course with little or no success this support berge and huard \\n conclusion nora and snyder   also note a dearth of quantitative research  \\n few quantitative study exist that support high or equal retention in online \\n student compare to their classroombase counterpart one example be the carmel and \\n gold   study they find no significant difference in student retention rate \\n between student in distance education course and their traditional classroombase \\n counterpart the study utilize datum from   student   enrol in classroombase \\n course and   enrol in a hybrid online format participant randomly selfselecte and \\n be not all enrol in the same course introduce variable not attribute in the study  \\n the majority of quantitative study instead conclude there be a high retention \\n rate in traditional classroom than in distance education in the phipp and merisotis \\n  review of russell original research which include online education result \\n indicate that research have show even low retention rate in online student than in \\n student attend class in the traditional college set the high dropout rate among \\n distance education student be not address in russell metaanalysis and phipp and \\n merisotis find no suitable explanation in the research they postulate that the \\n decrease retention rate document within distance education study skew \\n achievement datum by exclude the dropout \\n diaz   find a high drop rate for online student compare to traditional \\n classroombase student in an online health education course at nova southeastern \\n other study have support the theory that retention of online student be far below that \\n  \\n\\u00a0\\n of the traditional campus student in   carr report for the chronicle of high \\n education note that online course routinely lose    of student who originally \\n enrol as compare to a retention rate of   of traditional facetoface student \\n carr report dropout rate of up to   in online course as a likely indicator of the \\n difficultly face in retain distance education student who do not routinely meet with \\n faculty the datum have not be refute \\n as community college begin utilize distance education retention rate be \\n report as high than traditional student nash   however the california \\n community college system report for fall   course show inconsistent retention \\n result for distance education learner vary by the type of course result indicate \\n equivalent retention rate for online instruction compare to traditional coursework in the \\n majority of course low retention rate be indicate in online engineering social \\n science and mathematic course as compare to traditional classroom instructional \\n model california community college chancellor office  \\n due to the limited number of vocationaltechnical or occupational course teach \\n in the online mode there be little datum on student retention in   hogan study \\n technical course and program completion of student in distance and traditional \\n vocational education and find that course completion rate be high for distance \\n education student however program completion rate be high for traditional \\n student than for student enrol in distance education hogan   \\n in summary study of retention have focus primarily on student characteristic \\n while acknowledge that postsecondary retention rate vary accord to a variety of \\n factor research show mixed result concern the retention rate of online student \\n  \\n\\u00a0\\n though quantitative datum lean heavily toward a low course retention rate in online \\n student datum from year university have show low retention rate for online \\n student than for traditional facetoface student while community college have show \\n inconsistent result datum from vocationaltechnical education have be limit but \\n course retention rate be high for online student while program retention rate be \\n low no significant research factor affect retention have be isolate between \\n student in online baccalaureate completion program and student participate in \\n traditional classroombase setting \\n summary \\n \\n research study have be conduct analyze student retention in high \\n education transfer and retention of student from community college to university the \\n impact of distance education and student achievement and retention factor relate to \\n distance education however no comparative research be identify that compare the \\n achievement and retention of student participate in an occupationally orient transfer \\n program utilize both online education and traditional classroombase instruction \\n chapter three address the

recommendation for further research the purpose of the latter section be to expand on \\n the research into distance education include implication for expansion of course and \\n program delivery and future research finally a summary be offer to capture the scope \\n and substance of what have be offer in the research \\n study summary \\n the online delivery of course content in high education have increase \\n dramatically in the past decade allen and seaman a report that almost  \\n million student participate in at least one online course during the fall   term a \\n nearly   increase over the number report in the previous year they also report a \\n  increase in online enrollment compare to the   growth in overall high \\n education as online delivery have grow so have criticism of its efficacy \\n online delivery of education have become an important strategy for the institution \\n that be the setting of this study the purpose of this study be threefold the first purpose \\n of the study be to determine if there be a significant difference between the course \\n grade of student participate in ta online course and their traditional classroom \\n base counterpart the second purpose of the study be to determine if there be a \\n  \\n\\u00a0\\n significant difference between course retention of student participate in ta online \\n course and their traditional classroombase counterpart a third purpose of the study \\n be to determine if there be a significant difference between program retention of \\n student who begin the ta program in online course and those who begin the program \\n enrol in traditional facetoface course the study be design to expand the \\n knowledge base concern online education and its efficacy in provide baccalaureate \\n degree completion opportunity \\n the research design be a quantitative study to compare course grade course \\n retention and program retention of student enrol in the online and traditional faceto \\n face ta program at washburn university archival datum from the student system at \\n washburn university be utilize to compare online and traditional facetoface student \\n in order to answer research question   a sample of student enrol in ta   and ta \\n  online and traditional facetoface course be analyze the sample include \\n student enter the program in the fall semester of      and  \\n two instructor be responsible for concurrent instruction of both the online and face \\n toface class for the period analyze a twofactor analysis of variance be use to \\n analyze for a potential difference in the dependent variable course grade due to \\n delivery method online and facetoface the instructor instructor a and b and the \\n potential interaction between the two independent variable research question   \\n a chisquare test for difference among proportion be use to analyze both \\n course and program retention research question   and   for research question  \\n archived datum from the washburn university student system be analyze for student \\n enrol in ta   and ta   additional variable identify for this sample include \\n  \\n\\u00a0\\n course selection and instructor a or b for research question   archive datum from the \\n washburn university system be use which identify student with declare \\n technology administration major who begin the ta program enrol in online and \\n facetoface course a single gatekeeper course ta   be identify for test two \\n instructor a and b be responsible for instruction during the testing period  \\n \\n a twofactor anova be utilize to test h there be a statistically significant \\n difference in course grade of student participate in online course and student \\n enrol in a traditional classroom set at the   level of significance anova \\n testing be utilize to account for the two delivery method and two instructor involve \\n for the period of the study the result of the test indicate there be no statistically \\n significant difference in grade due to delivery method the result of the testing also \\n indicate no statistically significant difference in grade due to instructor and no \\n interaction between the two independent variable the research hypothesis be not \\n support \\n \\n to test the next hypothesis chisquare testing be utilize h there be a \\n statistically significant difference in student course retention between student \\n participate in online course and student enrol in facetoface course at the  \\n level of significance   the result of the chisquare testing indicate there be no \\n statistically significant difference in course retention of student enrol in online \\n course and student enrol in facetoface course in the ta program the research \\n hypothesis be not support \\n \\n to test the final hypothesis chisquare testing be also use h there be a \\n statistically significant difference in program retention between student who begin the \\n  \\n\\u00a0\\n technology administration program in online course and student who begin in faceto \\n face course at the   level of significance the result of the chisquare testing \\n indicate there be no statistically significant difference in the program retention rate of \\n student who begin the ta program in the online course and student who begin the \\n program in the facetoface course the research hypothesis be not support testing \\n find that course retention be high in both format lead to interpretation that high \\n result may be due to the age of participant or prior degree completion \\n the result find no significant difference in grade course or program retention \\n for student in online ta course and student enrol in traditional facetoface \\n instruction the implication of these result compare to current literature be discuss in \\n the next section \\n finding relate to the literature \\n \\n online education have become a strategy for high education to provide \\n instruction to student limit by distance or time or who for other reason do not wish \\n to attend traditional classroombase university class additionally online education \\n allow high education institution to expand their geographic base institution have \\n utilize distance education for over a century to provide instruction but it be only \\n within the last two decade that instruction over the internet have replace \\n correspondence television and video course as the method of choice for delivery \\n russell  \\n \\n utilize grade as a measure of achievement metaanalyse conduct by \\n russell   shachar and neumann   and machtme and asher   find no \\n significant difference in grade of online student and traditional classroombase \\n  \\n\\u00a0\\n student these analyse utilize multiple study of course information compare \\n grade of online student and traditional facetoface student primarily utilize t test \\n as the preferred methodology the result of previous research be support by the \\n present study additionally this study go far analyze datum over more than one \\n semester control for the effect of different instructor these result be contrary to \\n the conclusion reach by phipp and merisotis  \\n \\n the second purpose of the study be to determine if a significant difference \\n exist between the course retention of student enrol in online ta course and \\n student enrol in facetoface course metaanalyse conduct by phipps and \\n merisotis   and nora and snyder   conclude a much low course retention \\n rate in online student as compare to their facetoface counterpart the previous meta \\n analysis examine retention of online student and traditional facetoface student in \\n distinct course utilize t test as the primary methodology the choose method of t \\n test be use instead of the chi square testing due to the limitation of the study to one \\n course teach by one instructor limit to one semester or cycle carr   report in \\n the chronicle of high education that retention of online student be   less than \\n that of traditional facetoface student carr result be base on the examination of \\n longitudinal retention datum from university as report to the united states department \\n of education  \\n the result of the present study find no significant difference in the course \\n retention rate these result be support by the finding of carmel and gold   in \\n which they report no significant difference in course retention rate of online student \\n compare to traditional facetoface student in their analysis of student in multiple \\n  \\n\\u00a0\\n course in discipline across a year university the present study expand those \\n result examine course datum in the same discipline over a year period and control \\n for delivery by two separate instructor  \\n \\n research into program completion rate of aas student have be conduct \\n primarily in traditional university setting include townsend   study at the \\n university of missouricolumbia townsend result show a low baccalaureate \\n completion rate for student enter with an aas than student who transfer to \\n year university with an aa degree study by hogan   of vocationaleducation \\n program also find a low program completion rate for online student compare to \\n student in traditional delivery vocational education program analysis of the datum in the \\n current study show no significant difference in program completion rate of student \\n who begin in online ta course as compare to student who begin the program in face \\n toface course  \\n conclusion \\n \\n the use of distance education for postsecondary instruction primarily in the form \\n of the internet have both change and challenge the view of traditional universitybased \\n instruction multiple study have be design in an effort to examine whether online \\n student have the same level of academic achievement as their traditional high \\n education peer the present study agree with the research indicate there be no \\n statistically significant difference in the grade of online student and their facetoface \\n counterpart in addition with student retention an issue for all postsecondary \\n institution the datum from previous study indicate a low retention rate for online \\n student than for their traditional facetoface classmate the current study contradict \\n  \\n\\u00a0\\n those argument in the follow section implication for action recommendation for \\n research and concluding remark be address \\n implication for action \\n \\n as postsecondary institution move into the st century many have examine \\n issue of student recruitment and retention in an effort to meet the demand of both their \\n student and their community the majority of postsecondary institution have initiate \\n online education as a strategy to recruit student from beyond their traditional geographic \\n area this study support exist research utilize grade as a measure of \\n achievement and should alleviate doubt that online student be shortchange in their \\n education the transition of exist facetoface to course to an online delivery model \\n can be accomplish without sacrifice achievement of course and program goal \\n \\n the study also examine course and program retention datum find no significant \\n difference between online and traditional student in the ta program the finding of \\n this study support the expansion of additional online course and program within the \\n school of apply study  \\n finally this study can provide the basis for further action include analyze \\n other program and course offer in the online format by the university the analysis \\n of other program offer in an online delivery model would enhance further \\n development of online course and program \\n recommendation for future research \\n distance education delivery have expand dramatically with the use of the \\n internet for online instruction the present study could be continue in future year to \\n measure the effect of specific curriculum delivery model and change make to online \\n  \\n\\u00a0\\n delivery platform in addition the study could be expand to include specific \\n characteristic of student retention name in the literature such as examine whether the \\n age and enter gpa of student provide any insight into course and program retention \\n the study could also be expand to include other university with similar \\n baccalaureatedegree completion program and other discipline
