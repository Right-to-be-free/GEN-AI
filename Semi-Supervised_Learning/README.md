Semi-Supervised Learning Guide
What is Semi-Supervised Learning?
**Definition**: Semi-Supervised Learning is a machine learning approach that uses a small amount of labeled data along with a large amount of unlabeled data during training.
**Analogy**: Like learning in a classroom where the teacher gives a few examples, and students figure out the rest by discussion and pattern recognition.
```python
# Example: Self-training using labeled and unlabeled data
from sklearn.semi_supervised import SelfTrainingClassifier
base_model = LogisticRegression()
model = SelfTrainingClassifier(base_model)
model.fit(X_combined, y_combined)
```
Why Semi-Supervised Learning?
Reduces the need for costly labeled data.
Improves accuracy by leveraging large unlabeled datasets.
Balances supervised and unsupervised approaches.
Key Concepts
- **Labeled Data**: Data with known outputs.
- **Unlabeled Data**: Data with unknown outputs.
- **Confidence Thresholds**: Determines when to accept predictions as pseudo-labels.
- **Pseudo-labeling**: Assigning labels to unlabeled data based on model predictions.
Common Techniques
- **Self-training**: Iteratively label and retrain using high-confidence predictions.
- **Co-training**: Train multiple models on different views and label each other's data.
- **Graph-based Models**: Use data similarities to propagate labels.
- **Semi-Supervised SVM**: Extends SVMs using both labeled and unlabeled data.
Popular Algorithms & Tools
- SelfTrainingClassifier (scikit-learn)
- Label Spreading / Label Propagation
- Semi-supervised K-Means
- MixMatch, FixMatch (Deep Learning)
```python
from sklearn.semi_supervised import LabelPropagation
model = LabelPropagation()
model.fit(X_combined, y_combined)
```
Applications of Semi-Supervised Learning
- Text classification with few labeled documents.
- Image classification with partial labeling.
- Fraud detection with limited confirmed fraud labels.
- Speech and audio recognition tasks.
- Medical diagnosis with annotated patient subsets.
Model Evaluation Strategies
- Use a labeled validation/test set for evaluation.
- Compare with fully supervised baseline.
- Track pseudo-label accuracy over iterations.
Challenges
- Incorrect pseudo-labels can mislead the model.
- Hard to tune confidence thresholds.
- Requires careful monitoring of training performance.
Best Practices
- Start with high-quality labeled data.
- Regularly validate pseudo-labeled samples.
- Use thresholding to avoid noisy labels.
- Combine with active learning when possible.

Semi-Supervised Learning - Real Life Examples
1. Email Classification with Limited Labels
Problem
A company wants to classify incoming emails as spam or not spam but has labeled only 1% of their emails.
Solution
Train a model with the labeled emails and apply pseudo-labeling to include high-confidence predictions on the unlabeled ones.
Implementation
```python
from sklearn.semi_supervised import SelfTrainingClassifier
model = SelfTrainingClassifier(LogisticRegression())
model.fit(X_combined, y_combined)
```
Impact
Reduced manual labeling cost while improving email filtering accuracy.
Conclusion
Semi-supervised learning boosted performance without relying entirely on expensive human-annotated data.
2. Medical Diagnosis from X-rays with Few Expert Labels
Problem
Radiologists label only a small set of X-ray images due to high cost and time.
Solution
Use semi-supervised learning to learn from the limited labeled and many unlabeled X-ray images.
Implementation
Combine CNN-based deep learning with pseudo-labeling and consistency regularization.
Impact
Achieved similar accuracy to fully labeled datasets with only 20% labeled data.
Conclusion
Greatly reduced labeling overhead in medical imaging with scalable accuracy.
3. Voice Recognition with Partial Transcripts
Problem
Only some audio files have corresponding transcripts for training a speech-to-text model.
Solution
Use labeled audio to train an initial model and generate pseudo-transcripts for unlabeled audio.
Implementation
Models like DeepSpeech or Wav2Vec with semi-supervised fine-tuning.
Impact
Expanded dataset from 10 hours labeled to 100+ hours usable data.
Conclusion
SS learning enabled richer speech models in low-resource scenarios.
4. Product Categorization in E-Commerce
Problem
Millions of products are uploaded, but only a small portion are manually categorized.
Solution
Use labeled examples to propagate labels to similar products via label spreading.
Implementation
```python
from sklearn.semi_supervised import LabelSpreading
model = LabelSpreading()
model.fit(X_combined, y_combined)
```
Impact
Automated product taxonomy improved search and recommendation accuracy.
Conclusion
Efficiently expanded product classification coverage using existing data.
5. Fraud Detection with Incomplete Annotations
Problem
Banks often know about only a small set of confirmed fraudulent transactions.
Solution
Train a semi-supervised model to generalize fraud patterns from limited confirmed cases.
Implementation
Combine anomaly detection with self-training on partially labeled financial data.
Impact
Detected hidden fraud with fewer false positives than a purely supervised system.
Conclusion
SS learning improved fraud detection when confirmed fraud labels were scarce.
